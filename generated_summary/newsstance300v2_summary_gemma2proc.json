{"173": "The claim that a bank employee embezzles large amounts of money by stealing small sums from many different accounts is supported by several examples. One case involves a programmer who systematically diverted small amounts from hundreds of checking accounts, transferring them to a dummy account. This method, known as the \"salami technique,\" relies on the inconspicuous nature of small withdrawals that are unlikely to be noticed by individual customers. Another example illustrates how programmers manipulated a company's computer to increase tax withholdings from employees' paychecks, effectively stealing the money through a series of small, incremental thefts. These examples demonstrate how individuals can exploit computer systems to embezzle significant sums by accumulating small, seemingly insignificant amounts over time.", "143": "There have been reports circulating about cheap soy sauce being made from the hair of Chinese convicts, but the evidence is inconclusive. Some sources claim that manufacturers in China have used amino acid syrups derived from human hair to produce inexpensive soy sauce. These syrups, obtained from barber shops, hospitals, and salons, are mixed with other ingredients to create a soy sauce-like product. However, there's no concrete evidence linking this practice to convict labor. While the Chinese government has banned the production of soy sauce using hair-derived amino acids, it's unclear if this ban specifically targeted convict hair.", "200": "Donald Trump expressed his willingness to debate Bernie Sanders, stating he'd \"love to\" and suggesting it could raise funds for charity. He believes it would be a win-win situation and has discussed the possibility with networks. However, Trump's conditions, such as raising a substantial amount for charity and holding it in a large arena, make it unlikely before the California primary. This proposal comes after Hillary Clinton declined to debate Sanders before the California vote, which Trump views as putting Clinton in a bind.  Despite his desire to debate Sanders, Trump also stated that he would prefer to debate the Democratic frontrunner, likely Clinton, after the primary.", "217": "The claim that TSA confiscated nail clippers from a U.S. soldier returning from Afghanistan is disputed.  A statement from the Indiana National Guard asserts that TSA personnel do not have access to the facility where military charters are processed at Indianapolis International Airport. Additionally, the TSA directly refutes the claim, stating that nail clippers have never been prohibited items and were allowed even before the TSA's establishment.  However, an individual who claims to have been on the flight states that TSA agents did confiscate nail clippers and multi-tools.", "187": "Some believe the cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are evidence of alien life, pointing to unique genetic mutations found in samples from the Paracas skulls that differ from any known human, primate, or animal DNA.  However, others argue that the DNA evidence is inconclusive and could be attributed to contamination or defects in the testing process.  Archaeologists maintain that these skulls belong to humans who lived around 2,000 years ago and that the elongated shape is a result of intentional cranial deformation, a practice common in some ancient cultures. This practice, they say, served social purposes, such as promoting group cohesion and signaling trustworthiness within communities.", "142": "There have been claims that Kellogg's is adding trace amounts of peanut flour to its products, citing the company's recent addition of peanut flour to Keebler and Austin crackers as evidence. This practice is allegedly intended to circumvent the complexities and costs associated with complying with new Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) regulations regarding allergen handling.  However, Kellogg's vehemently denies these claims, stating that their food safety standards are in full compliance with FSMA and FDA regulations. They emphasize their robust allergen control measures and commitment to labeling allergens accurately.  Despite Kellogg's denial, some believe the company is preemptively adding peanut flour to products to avoid the costs of FSMA compliance.", "179": "CFL light bulbs emit more electromagnetic fields (EMF) than incandescent bulbs, but the levels are not considered harmful. EMF intensity decreases significantly with distance, rendering the levels emitted by CFLs at typical viewing distances negligible.  CFLs also emit low levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but this is filtered by the glass envelope and any additional shielding materials in fixtures.  Studies have shown that CFLs do not pose a health hazard from UV radiation or EMF at distances of 30 cm or more. The World Health Organization concludes that current evidence does not support a link between low-level EMF exposure and health problems like headaches, anxiety, or depression.", "149": "In the 1950s, Las Vegas was highly segregated, with African Americans facing discrimination in all aspects of hospitality.  Dorothy Dandridge, a renowned black entertainer, experienced this firsthand. While performing at the Last Frontier Hotel, she was forbidden from using the swimming pool.  The hotel threatened to drain the pool if she even attempted to enter. Dandridge, known for her defiance, dipped her toe in the water as a symbolic act of protest.  As a consequence, the hotel immediately drained the pool, enforcing their discriminatory policy. This incident highlights the extreme racism prevalent in Las Vegas during that era.", "175": "Several individuals have reported receiving numerous parking tickets despite not actually parking illegally. This occurred after they chose personalized license plates with wording similar to \"NO TAG,\" \"VOID,\" or \"UNKNOWN.\"  The issue stems from parking enforcement officers using these same phrases when recording vehicles without license plates on parking citations. Consequently, the system mistakenly associates these tickets with the individuals' vehicles, leading to a barrage of unpaid parking violations.  One person even received 8,000 in tickets due to the \"NOTAG\" plate, highlighting the severity of this issue.", "180": "There have been reports circulating about a gang initiation ritual involving rear-end collisions and subsequent shootings.  A police commissioner in Buffalo issued an alert based on credible information suggesting that a Central American gang is using this tactic to recruit members.  They advise drivers to avoid exiting their vehicles if involved in such an incident and to call 911 instead.  However, other police departments, including those in Fayetteville and Tallahassee, have dismissed these claims as urban legends, stating they have no evidence to support them.  The spread of these warnings has been attributed to text messages and email.", "208": "The Dover Air Force Base mortuary disposed of portions of unidentified or unclaimed troops' remains by cremation and dumping the ashes in a Virginia landfill from 2003 to 2008. This practice involved over 274 service members.  The Air Force claims the procedure was authorized by family members who signed forms consenting to the disposal of unidentifiable remains.  The military stated they did not inform families because they had signed forms allowing for \"appropriate disposition\" of such remains. The practice was discontinued in 2008 in favor of burial at sea.  Media coverage of the return of fallen troops to Dover was banned from 1991 until 2009, potentially contributing to the lack of public awareness about the landfill disposal.", "193": "The claim alleges that Bill Clinton fathered a son named Danney Williams with a former prostitute named Bobbie Ann Williams in 1985. Bobbie Ann Williams claimed Clinton had a sexual relationship with her, leading to the child's conception. However, DNA tests conducted by the FBI, using data from the Starr Report, showed no match between Clinton and Danney Williams. Despite the inconclusive nature of the less specific DNA test used, the results were deemed insufficient to establish paternity. The tabloid that initially reported the story, The Globe, acknowledged the lack of evidence and stated they would not publish unsubstantiated claims.", "146": "The claim that women's menstrual cycles synchronize when they live or work in close proximity is widely believed but lacks strong scientific support. Some studies suggest that menstrual cycle differences between women may appear to decrease due to chance factors rather than actual synchrony. Research analyzing data from hundreds of women using a period tracking app found that the majority of pairs showed an increase in cycle start date differences over time, not a decrease.  Furthermore, studies examining women living in close proximity, such as roommates, have found no statistically significant evidence of cycle synchronization.  The belief in menstrual synchrony may stem from a misunderstanding of the natural variability in menstrual cycles and a tendency to notice coincidences more than discrepancies.", "219": "The claim that certain localities in the U.S., France, and Britain function as Muslim \"no-go zones\" governed by Sharia Law is largely unsubstantiated.  While some areas experience higher crime rates and tensions, there's no evidence of formal designations or widespread exclusion based on religion.  Claims of police avoidance and Sharia courts operating freely within these zones are inaccurate.  Some areas, often referred to as \"sensitive urban zones,\" may see sporadic unrest, but they are not lawless or completely inaccessible.  It's important to note that these areas are diverse and not representative of the entire Muslim population.", "47": "A video went viral showing a weatherman seemingly caught urinating in the bushes during a live broadcast. The incident involved Mike Seidel, who was reporting from Sugar Mountain, North Carolina.  Viewers saw Seidel with his back to the camera, leading to speculation about his actions.  However, Brian Williams, the NBC Nightly News anchor, clarified the situation, stating that Seidel was actually trying to re-establish communication with the control room after losing contact. Seidel had taken off his gloves to dial his phone, leading to the misunderstanding. Williams apologized to Seidel for the false accusations circulating on social media.", "45": "Brian Williams publicly defended Weather Channel meteorologist Mike Seidel, stating that Seidel was the victim of misinformation. Williams explained that Seidel lost contact with the NBC control room and was hunched over dialing his phone, not urinating as social media speculated.  However, other reports and videos depict Seidel seemingly caught in the act of urinating while on-air.  A video shows Seidel caught off guard by the camera, appearing to be adjusting his clothing and muttering \"why?\" when prompted to give his forecast.  The incident occurred while Seidel was supposed to be delivering a live weather report from North Carolina.", "215": "The NRA's stance on firearm possession at its national convention has sparked controversy.  While the organization advocates for widespread gun ownership, it has implemented a policy prohibiting firearms at its convention, citing safety concerns.  Attendees are allowed to carry firearms in the convention center, Music City Center, in accordance with Tennessee law, but Bridgestone Arena, where an NRA-sponsored concert is held, prohibits firearms as per its existing policy.  The NRA has clarified that display firearms at vendor booths have their firing pins removed as a safety precaution, a common practice at similar events.  Gun sales at the convention follow established federal and state laws, with orders processed through licensed dealers and subject to background checks.", "164": "A petition alleges that Starbucks, alongside Monsanto, is suing Vermont to prevent the implementation of GMO labeling regulations. The petition claims Starbucks and Green Mountain Coffee are fighting against accurate food labeling and urges people to pressure Starbucks into withdrawing its support for the lawsuit. However, Starbucks vehemently denies these claims, stating they are not part of any lawsuit related to GMO labeling and have not funded any campaigns against Vermont's state law. They assert that the petition's description of their position is false and emphasize their preference for a national solution to GMO labeling.", "162": "The Moomba festival in Melbourne has been celebrated since 1954 and is known for its vibrant atmosphere. While the festival's organizers claim the name \"Moomba\" comes from an Aboriginal word meaning \"Let's get together and have fun,\" this is disputed.  Several sources reveal that \"moom\" actually means \"buttocks\" or \"anus\" in Victorian Aboriginal languages, and the suffix \"ba\" can mean \"at,\" \"in,\" or \"on.\"  This suggests that \"Moomba\" translates to something like \"up your bum.\"  The true origin of the name is attributed to Bill Eric Onus, an Aboriginal elder who, with a sense of humor, provided the word knowing its vulgar meaning, thus gifting the Aboriginal community with a long-lasting joke at the expense of the festival organizers.", "163": "A Michigan farmer's claim that he was forced to destroy 40,000 edible cherries to make way for imported cherries is partially misleading. While the farmer did have to destroy a portion of his crop, the amount was 14% as mandated by the tart cherry marketing order, not 40,000 cherries. This order aims to stabilize cherry prices and supply by diverting a percentage of the crop from traditional markets. The farmer's assertion that he was prohibited from donating or using the diverted cherries is also incorrect.  Farmers can utilize these cherries for research, development, or donation to charities. The marketing order is designed to benefit the entire industry, although some growers, like the one who made the Facebook post, disagree with its implementation.", "194": "An Islamic tribunal operates in the Dallas area, offering a forum for resolving business and non-criminal disputes based on Islamic principles.  The tribunal's rulings are non-binding and adhere to U.S. law, functioning similarly to religious mediation services for other faiths.  While the tribunal's members state that Sharia law generally aligns with Texas law, they acknowledge that conflicts may arise.  In such cases, parties can choose to appeal to Texas civil courts.  The tribunal emphasizes voluntary participation and does not specify consequences for non-compliance with its rulings.", "205": "Claims have been made that a spike in carbon monoxide levels on the West Coast signals an impending massive earthquake. However, evidence suggests otherwise. Initial reports linking CO spikes to earthquakes were based on a geophysicist's research, but subsequent analysis revealed that the elevated CO levels were actually caused by methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon ground storage facility and pollution from fires. Further, NASA satellite data has been found to be inaccurate, contributing to the initial misinterpretation of CO levels. Experts in seismology emphasize that there is currently no scientific basis for predicting earthquakes based on CO spikes or any other known method. They caution against alarmist claims and emphasize the lack of reliable earthquake prediction methods.", "155": "Organ donation procedures strictly adhere to the principle that a donor must be legally dead before organ removal.  This means the donor's heart must have permanently stopped or they must be declared brain dead. Brain death is a state of irreversible coma where there is no chance of recovery or experiencing pain.  While some individuals might be kept alive on ventilators after brain death, they are legally and medically considered deceased. Organ donation can occur from both brain-dead and non-heart-beating donors. In non-heart-beating donation, life support is withdrawn, and the body is kept on a ventilator until death occurs.  Pain management is provided throughout the process.", "150": "Peanut oil has been investigated as an ingredient in vaccines, particularly as an adjuvant to enhance immune response.  While research explored peanut oil-based adjuvants like \"Adjuvant 65,\"  concerns about its safety and potential for adverse reactions led to its discontinuation for human use.  Although peanut oil was used in some vaccines in the past, it is not currently a standard ingredient in childhood vaccines or flu shots.  The use of peanut oil in vaccines was not a secret, as it was documented in scientific publications and even mentioned in a New York Times article in 1964.  The claim that peanut oil is secretly present in vaccines is therefore not supported by the available evidence.", "151": "Some studies suggest that induced abortion may be a risk factor for breast cancer, indicating a small but potentially significant increase in risk. However, other studies have found no association between abortion and breast cancer risk.  Concerns have been raised about the reliability of some studies, particularly those relying on retrospective reporting of abortion history, as women with breast cancer may be more likely to disclose past abortions than those without the disease.  Furthermore, regional variations in study findings, potentially influenced by reporting bias, have also been noted.  Despite these uncertainties, several large-scale, well-designed studies, including one published in the New England Journal of Medicine, have found no link between abortion and breast cancer risk. The National Cancer Institute, after reviewing extensive evidence, concluded that induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.", "27": "A video claiming to show a bird pooping on Vladimir Putin during a speech at a World War I monument unveiling in Moscow was widely circulated online. However, evidence suggests the incident is fake. Multiple videos and photographs from the event, including those from international agencies, show no sign of bird droppings on Putin's suit. Comparisons of the doctored video with unaltered footage clearly demonstrate the manipulation. Additionally, pictures taken before and after the speech show Putin's suit remaining clean, further supporting the claim that the bird poop incident was fabricated.", "213": "The family of Anne Frank desperately sought refugee status in the United States, facing a complex and increasingly restrictive immigration process. Otto Frank, Anne's father, reached out to influential contacts like Nathan Straus Jr. and the National Refugee Service, even securing affidavits from potential employers. However, the U.S. government implemented stricter policies, particularly barring refugees with close relatives in Europe due to fears of Nazi blackmail. Despite these challenges, Otto Frank managed to obtain a visa for himself, but it was canceled when Germany declared war on the United States.  Ultimately, the Frank family's efforts to escape to the U.S. were thwarted by a combination of Nazi persecution and U.S. immigration restrictions.", "201": "Doctors have warned about a growing trend of \"sex roulette\" parties, where one participant in a group sex encounter is HIV-positive, without disclosing their status. These parties, often attended by gay men, are described as offering a \"thrill\" due to the unknown risk of infection. Some parties reportedly involve attendees taking antiviral drugs to minimize transmission risk. However, there are doubts about the widespread existence of these parties, with some questioning the logistics and lack of concrete evidence beyond anecdotal reports from a few doctors and a psychotherapist. The claim has been fueled by media sensationalism and stories about \"bug chasing,\" a phenomenon where some HIV-negative individuals seek out HIV infection, which has existed for some time but lacks widespread evidence.", "196": "A federal lawsuit alleges that the Kenosha Unified School District instructed transgender students to wear bright green wristbands to monitor their restroom usage. The lawsuit claims this practice was discriminatory and caused the student, Ash Whitaker, significant distress, fearing for his safety and privacy. The school district denies this claim, stating they do not have a policy requiring any student to wear wristbands for monitoring purposes and are confident their practices are compliant with all laws. They claim some factual allegations in the lawsuit are false.", "137": "A former journalist and several former Facebook news curators allege that Facebook workers suppressed conservative news stories from the trending news section. They claim workers were instructed to prioritize stories from specific media outlets, often excluding conservative sources like Breitbart and The Blaze, and to artificially inject selected stories, regardless of their popularity. However, Facebook maintains that it has no evidence to support these claims and is conducting a full investigation. They assert that their guidelines prohibit prioritizing one viewpoint over another and that Trending Topics is designed to surface the most popular conversations. Facebook also emphasizes its commitment to inclusivity and openness, stating that it welcomes diverse perspectives.", "224": "President Obama's actions surrounding the raid that killed Osama bin Laden have been the subject of debate. Some accounts portray Obama as a decisive leader who made the difficult call to authorize the operation and praised the team involved.  He personally thanked the SEALs and awarded them the Presidential Unit Citation, recognizing their bravery and skill. However, other accounts allege that Obama attempted to obstruct the operation, delaying his involvement until shortly before the raid. These accounts suggest that Obama's public statements take undue credit for the success, minimizing the role of the SEALs and intelligence professionals who carried out the mission.", "202": "Mississippi has passed a bill, the \"Mississippi Church Protection Act,\" which allows churches to establish security programs and designate members to carry concealed weapons for protection. The bill provides legal immunity to these security members for actions taken within the scope of their duties, including the use of deadly force. It also expands concealed carry laws in the state. Critics argue that the bill effectively grants churches \"sovereign\" status, allowing members to act as judge, jury, and executioner, potentially leading to extrajudicial killings. Supporters argue it's a necessary measure to protect churches from violence.  The bill specifically states that killing a person while acting as a participant of a church security team is considered justifiable homicide.", "182": "Some claim that swallowing active dry yeast before drinking alcohol can prevent intoxication. This theory suggests that the yeast's alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme will break down the alcohol before it reaches the bloodstream. However,  research indicates that ADH is inactive in the stomach's acidic environment, making this mechanism unlikely.  Anecdotal evidence from a self-proclaimed beer enthusiast who claims to drink heavily without getting drunk supports the theory, but this lacks scientific backing.  Additionally, consuming excessive yeast could potentially lead to the opposite effect, producing alcohol in the body.", "206": "Some doctors believe an increased number of microcephaly cases in Brazil is linked to the use of a Monsanto-manufactured pesticide called Pyriproxyfen. They argue that the pesticide, added to drinking water in 2014 to control mosquitoes, is responsible for the malformations in thousands of children. They point to the concentration of cases in impoverished areas of Northeastern Brazil where the pesticide was widely used. However, others maintain that the Zika virus is the primary cause of microcephaly, citing its spread in the Pacific and Colombia without a corresponding increase in birth defects. They argue that Pyriproxyfen is a safe pesticide, used in various countries without similar issues. They also highlight its breakdown in sunlight and low toxicity, allowing for its use near harvest.", "214": "The efficacy of a \"abortion pill reversal\" procedure using progesterone is highly debated. While some anecdotal evidence suggests it can be successful, scientific research remains limited and inconclusive. Some experts argue that progesterone's effect is negligible as mifepristone, the first pill in the abortion process, binds more strongly to progesterone receptors. Studies show that a significant percentage of women who take only the first pill already have a chance of continuing their pregnancy naturally.  Furthermore, a review of existing literature found only one poor-quality study supporting the reversal procedure, with limited patient data and unclear selection criteria.  Others suggest monitoring the pregnancy after taking the first pill is a more reliable approach.", "198": "The claim that top Obama administration officials watched the Benghazi attack unfold in real-time but did nothing to intervene is contested. Evidence suggests that President Obama, along with his top national security advisors, were briefed on the attack and received real-time video feeds.  They were also aware of the dire situation faced by American personnel trapped in the consulate.  Within 90 minutes, Obama directed his defense secretary and the Joint Chiefs to use all available resources to save lives. The defense secretary testified that he received clear orders to deploy military assets immediately.  However, the report also highlights bureaucratic delays and the initial misdirection of forces towards Tripoli rather than Benghazi, raising questions about the effectiveness of the response.", "189": "The standard procedure for presidential transitions involves political appointees, including ambassadors, submitting resignation letters around the time a new President is inaugurated. While this is typical practice, the incoming Trump administration took a hard line, demanding all political appointees resign by Inauguration Day without exceptions, unlike past administrations that often granted extensions. This unprecedented move, according to diplomats, threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys in critical nations for months.  The Trump transition team's stance, described as \"a blanket edict,\"  broke with decades of precedent and signaled a commitment to dismantling President Obama's foreign policy achievements.", "212": "Sarah Furay was arrested for drug possession and manufacturing charges after authorities found drugs and drug paraphernalia in her apartment. Furay's release on bond after one day in jail and the delayed indictment sparked speculation that her father, a DEA agent, had influenced the case. However, authorities explained the delay was due to backlogged state crime labs.  Eventually, Furay was indicted on four felony drug charges, including possession with intent to deliver cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD, and marijuana.  The charges carry significant prison sentences, suggesting that Furay's father's connections did not prevent prosecution.", "174": "The claim that Andy Kaufman faked his death has been fueled by various individuals and incidents. A man named Enrique Proust admitted to fabricating a press release claiming Kaufman's return, while Michael Kaufman, Andy's brother, initially suggested the possibility of his survival before backtracking. Bob Zmuda, a close friend, insists that if Kaufman were alive, he would know, and dismisses the claims. However, the appearance of a woman claiming to be Kaufman's daughter, despite inconsistencies in her age and identity, adds fuel to the fire.  Kaufman's friend Zmuda also believes Kaufman used a body double and is due to reappear soon.", "222": "There is conflicting information regarding whether U.S. troops overseas are no longer provided with breakfast due to budget cuts. Some reports indicate that breakfast has been eliminated at certain forward operating bases in Afghanistan, with troops receiving MREs instead of hot meals. This change is attributed to logistical streamlining and force reduction efforts, not budget cuts. However, other reports state that the vast majority of service members in Afghanistan continue to receive a hot breakfast.  The Department of Defense maintains that all soldiers are receiving four meals per day, including breakfast, though it may be an MRE at some locations.", "209": "A resident wrote a letter to the editor complaining about a low-flying formation of jets, believing it to be an unnecessary \"air show.\" He later clarified that he was unaware the flyby was in honor of a fallen serviceman, Captain Jeremy Fresques, who was being laid to rest at a memorial service. The resident apologized for his initial complaint, stating he was simply an uninformed citizen. The Air Force explained that the flyby was a respectful gesture for Captain Fresques, a fallen officer who died in Iraq. They emphasized the solemnity of the occasion and the significance of the flyby as a tribute to his service and sacrifice.", "147": "The claim that throwing rice at weddings kills birds is a persistent myth. Experts from organizations like the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and the USA Rice Federation assert that rice is not harmful to birds. They explain that rice expands only after being boiled and birds' digestive systems are capable of processing uncooked rice. Some individuals, like Rep. Mae Schmidle, have proposed legislation to ban rice throwing, citing concerns about birds ingesting raw rice and suffering fatal consequences. However, these claims lack scientific evidence and are contradicted by ornithologists who have extensive experience with bird behavior and feeding habits.  They emphasize that birds often consume rice found in fields and that there is no reason to believe it poses a threat to their health.", "197": "A video captured a small group chanting \"dead cops\" and \"now\" during a protest. The video's authenticity was verified by a forensic audio analyst. The video was posted online and sparked debate, with some suggesting it was doctored. The group chanting was not part of the main protest and appeared to be associated with a separate organization.  The video emerged after the killing of officers in New York City, and some suggested a connection to anti-police sentiment online.  However, there is no evidence linking the Baton Rouge killings to the chant in question.", "141": "Reports of the red-bellied pacu, a relative of the piranha with human-like teeth, biting off men's testicles and killing at least two victims have been circulating.  However, investigations in the Sepik River area found no evidence of deaths caused by pacu attacks. While some individuals reported being bitten, including one man who required medical attention for a bite to his genitals, no fatalities were confirmed.  Experts emphasize that pacus are primarily vegetarian, feeding on fruits and seeds, and their teeth are adapted for crushing, not tearing.  They suggest that the reports may stem from a misunderstanding of the fish's behavior and diet.", "195": "Reports initially claimed that President Clinton caused significant delays at LAX in 1993 to get a haircut from his stylist, Cristophe. This sparked controversy and was widely reported, with some outlets even suggesting the haircut caused planes to circle the airport. However, later investigations revealed that the reports were inaccurate. Federal Aviation Administration records showed that only one air taxi flight experienced a two-minute delay, and no other flights were significantly impacted.  The closure of two runways for Air Force One's departure caused minimal disruption due to light traffic that afternoon.", "244": "YouTuber Josh Paler Lin gave a homeless man named Thomas $100 and secretly filmed him to see how he would spend it.  Lin expected Thomas to buy alcohol but was surprised when he bought food to share with other homeless people. Thomas's actions touched Lin, who gave him an additional $100.  The video went viral, raising over $27,000 for Thomas through an Indiegogo campaign.  However, some people claim the video is a staged prank, citing an eyewitness who saw Lin and Thomas together before the filming. The eyewitness alleges that Thomas knew he was being filmed.  Despite the controversy, the video has sparked important conversations about homelessness and compassion.", "176": "The claim that states are installing \"point-to-point\" cameras to automatically ticket speeders is partially true. While some states, like Connecticut, have cameras along highways for traffic monitoring, they are not used for speed enforcement.  However, there are instances where point-to-point systems are in use.  Some highways utilize cameras at entry and exit points to calculate speed based on travel time. These systems issue fines automatically if the speed limit is exceeded.  Despite rumors circulating about secret speed fine systems, official statements from highway authorities have clarified that these systems are not secret and operate within existing speed enforcement laws.", "355": "Initially, there were reports stating that Christian Bale was set to play Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, with Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter, even confirming Bale's casting and praising his acting abilities.

She documented her post-surgery life on social media, showcasing her custom-made three-cup bras and bikinis. However, evidence suggests that the third breast might be a hoax. A stolen luggage report listed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" among her belongings. Additionally, her past history includes other internet hoaxes, raising doubts about the authenticity of her claim.  Despite the controversy, Tridevil maintains that she had the surgery and hopes to star in an MTV reality show.", "184": "Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were accused of promising to leave the USA if George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election. Baldwin vehemently denied making such a promise, stating that he never threatened to leave the country. Basinger, however, admitted to an interview where she suggested Baldwin might follow through on his threat. Baldwin attributed the confusion to director Robert Altman, who publicly stated his intention to move to France if Bush won. Despite the denial, Baldwin faced backlash from conservatives who urged him to leave the country. Baldwin clarified his stance, stating he would support Gore's campaign and raise funds to ensure Bush's defeat.", "356": "The claim that NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel was caught relieving himself on camera during a live broadcast is false. Seidel was actually trying to regain contact with the control room after losing his phone signal. While reporting from Sugar Mountain, North Carolina, Seidel was hunched over dialing his phone, attempting to reconnect. This incident was misinterpreted by viewers who saw him with his back to the camera and assumed he was urinating.  Seidel's spokesperson clarified that he was merely trying to establish communication and was unaware he was live on air.", "112": "The claim that catcalling is only funny when it's directed at men tricked into catcalling their mothers highlights a controversial point about street harassment.  While some argue that the act of men being catcalled by their own mothers is humorous, it's important to recognize the seriousness of street harassment. Videos have gone viral showcasing this tactic, where mothers disguise themselves and are catcalled by their sons. The resulting confrontations expose the absurdity and disrespect inherent in catcalling.  However, the humor derived from these situations should not overshadow the fact that street harassment is a pervasive issue affecting women globally, causing discomfort and fear.  The videos aim to raise awareness and encourage men to reconsider their behavior, emphasizing that catcalling is never acceptable.", "110": "Joan Rivers' doctor, Gwen Korovin, is denying allegations that she took a selfie with the comedian while she was under anesthesia before her death.

A specific instance in 2008 at the Shelbyville, Tennessee plant saw a temporary change where Labor Day was replaced by Eid al-Fitr as a paid holiday. This change was a result of a union-negotiated contract and applied only to that plant for that year.

However, others, including a University of Chicago archivist and alumni who attended school with Sanders, have expressed doubts about the photos' accuracy, believing they depict someone else.

While he was initially portrayed as a Wall Street prodigy with a net worth in the high eight figures, the teen himself has clarified that the $72 million figure is inaccurate. He stated that his earnings are closer to a few million dollars. Although he has achieved financial success through trading oil, gold, and stocks, the sensationalized portrayal of his wealth has caused him discomfort.

However, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau dismissed these claims in a video, stating that the girls had been married off and converted to Islam, and that there was no ceasefire.  Despite the government's assertions, violence continued, with Boko Haram attacks occurring after the alleged truce.  Shekau threatened the supposed negotiator and reiterated Boko Haram's refusal to negotiate.  Some officials questioned the legitimacy of the negotiator, raising doubts about the authenticity of the ceasefire. The government's claims of a ceasefire and the release of the girls appear to be contradicted by Boko Haram's actions and statements.", "123": "A New York high school student, Mohammed Islam, was initially portrayed as a trading prodigy who earned $72 million in the stock market. This claim, however, has been disputed by Islam himself and his investment club. Islam stated that the $72 million figure is inaccurate and that his net worth is in the \"high eight figures,\" but he declined to specify the exact amount. While he confirmed trading in oil and gold, contributing to his wealth, he emphasized that the media hype surrounding his earnings is exaggerated. The source of the initial $72 million figure remains unclear, with some suggesting it originated from rumors.", "262": "Initial reports suggested a small meteorite, possibly from the asteroid 2014 RC, caused a 40-foot-wide crater near Managua's international airport.  The impact was reportedly heard by residents, and Nicaraguan officials believed the crater was consistent with a meteorite strike. However, experts have raised doubts about the meteorite theory. They point out that no one witnessed a bright fireball, which would be expected with such an impact, and no meteorite fragments have been found.

Violence continued despite the alleged truce, with Boko Haram attacks on towns and a fatal bomb blast.  The Nigerian army reported clashes with Boko Haram militants, killing at least 25.  Elders in Borno state expressed doubt about the ceasefire's authenticity, suggesting the government might have negotiated with a faction rather than the entire group.  The lack of communication between Boko Haram and the Nigerian military, along with the continued violence, casts serious doubt on the effectiveness of the ceasefire.", "57": "The claim that a NYC high school student nicknamed \"Teen Wolf\" made $72 million on the stock market is highly disputed. While initial reports based on a New York Magazine profile suggested this figure, the student, Mohammed Islam, has since clarified that the $72 million figure is inaccurate. He stated that his net worth is closer to a few million dollars, and expressed discomfort with the sensationalized portrayal.

The mothers, disguised with makeup and wigs, confront their sons, who are shocked and embarrassed upon realizing their actions.  The video aims to highlight the inappropriateness of street harassment by showcasing the potential consequences and emotional impact it can have. While the video's authenticity has been questioned, its message resonates with many viewers who find the mothers' reactions to be both satisfying and effective in deterring such behavior.  The campaign successfully sparks conversation and raises awareness about the prevalence of street harassment, particularly towards women.", "4": "NASA has expressed skepticism about the claim that a meteorite caused a crater near Managua, Nicaragua. While Nicaraguan authorities initially attributed the crater to a fragment of the asteroid 2014 RC, NASA experts point to the lack of eyewitness accounts of a fireball, which should have been visible given the crater's size.  They also note that the crater's location is near a densely populated area, making it unlikely that no one would have seen such a phenomenon.  Furthermore, no meteorite fragments have been found at the site, which is another point of contention for NASA.", "91": "Argentina's president adopts the seventh child of Argentine families as a symbolic godchild, a tradition dating back over a century. This practice, unrelated to werewolf folklore, aims to counter the stigma associated with being the seventh child. The president provides a gold medal and educational scholarship to the adopted child. While a popular legend claims the seventh son transforms into a werewolf, Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda clarifies that the tradition and the myth are unrelated.  Recently, the president adopted Yair Tawil, the first Jewish child to receive this honor. This adoption, however, has been mistakenly linked to the werewolf myth by some media outlets.", "298": "The claim that Argentina's president adopted a Jewish godson to stop him from turning into a werewolf is largely based on a misunderstanding of an old Argentinian tradition.  While it's true that the president symbolically adopts the seventh child of a family, this practice is intended to counteract a superstition about seventh sons turning into werewolves, not to actually prevent it. This tradition dates back to the early 20th century and has traditionally been applied to Catholic children.  The recent adoption of a Jewish boy, however, highlights the evolution of the practice to be more inclusive.  The president's actions are symbolic and meant to offer support and recognition to families with seventh children, not to ward off any mythical curses.", "6": "The Pentagon confirmed the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the al-Shabab terror group, in a U.S. airstrike in Somalia. The strike targeted Godane and other high-ranking officials, resulting in the deaths of six individuals, including Godane.  U.S. officials initially acknowledged the strike but were cautious about confirming Godane's death until they had conclusive evidence. The White House declared the operation a counterterrorism success, highlighting Godane's role in the 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Kenya and his status as a key figure in al-Qaeda's affiliate in Africa. Godane's death is considered a significant blow to al-Shabab's operations and symbolism.

This tradition of presidential adoption began in 1907, initially as a response to a request from Russian immigrants who wanted their son to have the president as godfather.  While the adoption tradition predates the widespread fear of \"el lobison,\" the practice gained traction in the 19th century when families, fearing the legend, abandoned or even murdered their seventh sons.
