Now, the Senate Judiciary Committee's handling of another woman's sexual allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been criticized as the credibility of the Senate vetting process may be shot.

Rice described a protest of an anti-Islam video outside the mission buildings, but it was later discovered that the attack was a well- coordinated terrorist attack.

Windsor, considers the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denies federal benefits to same-sex couples married in the nine states where such unions are legal. The court could rule narrowly, overturning only California's ban, or broadly, forcing all states to strike down their man-woman marriage laws. The court could also decline to decide on the merits of the cases. The justices seemed divided, with the more liberal justices appearing open to the idea of same-sex marriage and the more conservative justices aligned with traditional notions of marriage. The decisions in these cases could have far-reaching implications for the legality of same-sex marriage and how sexual orientation should be treated when equal rights are an issue.", "elections_863": "The Iowa Democratic Party has announced that it would recanvass the results of Monday's caucuses following concerns over the accuracy of the vote count.

With a 53-47 seat Republican majority in the Senate and a two-thirds vote needed for conviction, it is almost certain the president will be acquitted. House impeachment managers and President Trump's legal team had two hours each to argue the case before senators took to the floor to deliver speeches explaining how they view the charges. Sen.

Kavanaugh is a Yale law school graduate who has spent 12 years on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. He has been praised by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as one of the most qualified nominees he has ever encountered. The hearing proceeded despite interruptions by protesters, with a total of 70 people charged in connection with protests at Tuesday's hearing. Kavanaugh is expected to tilt the high court to the right, especially on hot-button issues such as abortion and gun control. Sen.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., scoffed at Democrats who complained that Kavanaugh is too partisan.", "us_house_619": "The first public impeachment hearing in 20 years took place on Wednesday, featuring two career diplomats on the front lines of President Trump's dealings with Ukraine. William Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs, testified for more than five hours amid a media frenzy and partisan bickering over the future of the Trump presidency. Taylor described an \"irregular\" foreign policy channel with Ukraine led by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and expressed concerns about withholding nearly $400 million in security aid until Kyiv agreed to open investigations helpful to Trump's reelection.

The defeat is a major setback for the Trump administration, as it was the first big legislative test for Republicans since they won back the White House and retained control of the House and Senate in last fall's election. The bill was intended to replace the Affordable Care Act, a major campaign promise of the Republican party, but it has instead led to an embarrassing defeat for the party.

The race in Alabama was a referendum on the president's agenda and his relationship with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose help Trump needs to advance his legislative goals.

The appointment will not change the ideological breakdown of the court, but could nevertheless move it to the right.

While the move could be a major breakthrough, there are also significant risks involved, including the possibility that Kim may not negotiate in good faith or that Trump may get outmaneuvered by a smarter and more disciplined adversary. Nevertheless, the prospect of face-to-face talks is far better than the alternatives, which include the prospect of a catastrophic war.

She faced between five and 99 years or life in prison, and the jury considered but rejected a \"sudden passion\" defense that could have reduced her punishment to two to 20 years. Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and though prosecutors had asked for no less than 28 years, Jean's younger brother, Brandt Jean, asked the judge for permission to hug Guyger.

Overall, Americans have doubts that the trial will change their minds, with three-quarters of respondents saying it is unlikely that they will hear anything that would change their opinion about the president. Confidence in the Senate to conduct a fair trial is limited, though Republicans are more likely than Democrats to believe it will be fair.
