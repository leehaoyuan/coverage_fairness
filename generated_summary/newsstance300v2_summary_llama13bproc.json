{"173": "Computer-assisted embezzlement is a common method used by dishonest bank employees to steal money from multiple accounts. In one case, a programmer at a mail order sales company used a rounding technique to transfer small sums from various accounts to a dummy account, going unnoticed for three years until the company singled out the first and last accounts for ceremonial treatment. Another example involves a bank employee diverting small amounts of money from 300 checking accounts to a dummy account, using the computer to avoid detection. Additionally, rounding down fractional sums in interest-bearing accounts can also be used to embezzle money, with the surplus being diverted to a dummy account. Finally, two programmers at a garment firm instructed the company's computer to increase the amount withheld from employees' paychecks for federal taxes, directing the funds to their own accounts. These examples support the claim that bank employees can embezzle large amounts of money by stealing small sums from many different accounts.", "143": "There have been reports and investigations suggesting that some cheap soy sauce products in China are made from human hair, specifically from barber shop floors, hospitals, and salons. These reports were exposed by TV journalists and online publications, who found that the soy sauce manufacturers were using amino acid syrup derived from human hair to produce their products. The Chinese government has banned this practice, but it is still unclear how widespread it is and whether it affects all cheap soy sauce products. The use of human hair in soy sauce production raises concerns about the safety and quality of food products coming out of China.", "200": "Donald Trump expressed his willingness to debate Bernie Sanders, suggesting that he would love to debate the Democratic challenger and even set a high bar of raising $10-15 million for charity, including women's health issues. Hillary Clinton, however, declined to debate Sanders before the California primary, and Trump's campaign spokeswoman dismissed the idea of Trump debating Sanders as a joke. Despite this, Trump continued to express his openness to debating Sanders, suggesting that he would wait to debate the first place finisher in the Democratic Party, likely Hillary Clinton. The documents do not provide clear evidence that Trump agreed to debate Sanders after Clinton refused to participate in a final debate.", "217": "The claim that TSA confiscated nail clippers from a U.S. soldier returning from Afghanistan on a flight full of armed soldiers is false. According to the Indiana National Guard and TSA officials, TSA does not screen passengers at the facility where military charters arrive, and nail clippers have never been prohibited by TSA. Additionally, the story originated from an unattributed blog post and has been debunked by the National Guard and TSA. The myth that TSA confiscates nail clippers is likely an urban legend that has been perpetuated online.", "179": "There is no evidence to support the claim that CFL light bulbs are dangerous compared to conventional incandescent bulbs due to higher radiation emissions. While CFLs do emit more EMF in certain frequencies, the levels are not harmful and fall off sharply with distance. The glass used in CFLs already provides UV filtering, and additional filters can be used to further reduce exposure. Test results show that CFLs do not pose a significant risk of acute injury to the eyes or skin. The scientific literature does not support a link between low-level electromagnetic fields and health consequences. Anxiety and other factors may be causing reported symptoms attributed to CFL exposure.", "187": "While some genetic tests have revealed mutations in the DNA of the Paracas skulls that are unknown to any human, primate, or animal on Earth, other experts argue that these findings are not conclusive and could be caused by contaminants or defects in the testing process. Some anthropologists believe that the skulls may have been intentionally deformed for survival or group cohesion, rather than being of alien origin. However, the high foreheads of some of the skulls have been compared to the \"alien grey\" beings depicted in sci-fi films, fueling the speculation that they may have extraterrestrial origins. Ultimately, the debate continues, with no definitive answer to the question of whether the cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of human or alien origin.", "193": "Despite claims that Bill Clinton fathered an illegitimate, mixed-race son named Danney Williams with an Arkansas prostitute in 1985, there is no conclusive evidence to support this allegation. The Starr Report's FBI analysis of Clinton's DNA did not match with Danney's DNA, and subsequent genetic fingerprinting tests yielded only a \"paternity index\" of 20-30, which is not conclusive. Additionally, the mother of Danney Williams, Bobbie Ann Williams, has been shown to have a history of making false accusations and has been paid for her story. These findings suggest that the claim of Clinton fathering an illegitimate son is unfounded.", "208": "Between 2004 and 2008, the remains of over 250 soldiers were disposed of in a Virginia landfill, a practice that was not disclosed to their families. The Air Force admitted to the practice after an investigation, stating that the body parts were cremated and then incinerated before being taken to the landfill. This raises questions about the dignity and respect afforded to the fallen soldiers and their families. The mainstream media failed to report on the issue, further highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability in the handling of military remains.", "146": "While some studies suggest that women's menstrual cycles may synchronize when they live or work together, other research has found no evidence of synchrony. One study found that only 79 out of 360 pairs of women had a significant decrease in onset differences over time, while another study found that women in pairs and triples did not synchronize their menstrual cycles. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 19 primate species found that dominant males had less control over reproduction when females were receptive at the same time, which suggests that menstrual synchrony may not be an adaptive strategy for females. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence for menstrual synchrony in unindustrialized, natural fertility populations. Overall, the evidence is mixed and does not conclusively support the claim that women's menstrual cycles synchronize when they live or work in close proximity to one another.", "180": "According to the Buffalo Police Commissioner, there have been credible reports of a gang initiation rite involving rear-end collisions and shootings. The commissioner warns drivers not to get out of their vehicles if they are involved in such an incident, but to call 911 instead. Additionally, the police have received information that a dangerous street gang from Central America has arrived in Western New York and is holding an initiation where prospective members drive around the community and hit drivers from behind. However, other law enforcement agencies, such as the Fayetteville police, have found no credible evidence to support these claims. They believe the rumors of gang initiation are merely an urban legend and are spreading through text messaging and email. Overall, while there have been specific reports of gang-related incidents involving rear-end collisions and shootings, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that gang initiates are bumping their cars into others and shooting them.", "149": "In the 1950s, Dorothy Dandridge, a black entertainer, was not allowed to use the pool at a Las Vegas hotel due to her race. Despite her status as a headlining performer, she was restricted from accessing the pool and was even forbidden from hinting that she wanted to swim. The hotel management feared that her presence in the pool would cause complaints from white patrons, and they would drain the pool to prevent her from using it. This treatment highlights the deep-seated racial prejudice that existed in Las Vegas at the time, and it underscores the challenges that black performers faced in the entertainment industry during the 1950s.", "219": "While some sources suggest the existence of \"no-go zones\" in Europe where local laws are not applicable and Shariah courts operate, other sources dispute these claims. First-hand experiences in French banlieues and British cities like Birmingham indicate that these areas are not as extreme as portrayed, with order prevailing and greenery abounding. A Fox News pundit's claim that Birmingham is a Muslim-only city was called \"complete idiocy\" by the British Prime Minister. Official statements from France and England deny the existence of formal \"no-go zones\" and apologize for any offense caused by erroneous reporting. However, some sources suggest that there are areas of high crime in Europe where police and visitors may exercise caution, and that these areas may be characterized as \"amorphous\" and \"safe havens\" for Muslim communities.", "142": "Recent documents reveal that Kellogg's is intentionally adding traces of peanut flour to several product lines, including Keebler and Austin crackers, despite the company's denial of doing so. The addition of peanut flour is believed to be a preemptive measure to avoid complying with the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) directives that go into effect this September. The company has not issued a press release explaining their decision to add the allergen, leaving consumers and the allergic community in the dark. The addition of minute quantities of peanut flour raises concerns about the safety of the products and the company's priorities regarding food safety.", "175": "A series of bizarre incidents have raised eyebrows in several cities, as individuals with vanity license plates reading \"NO PLATE\" or similar variations have received notices for thousands of unpaid parking tickets. In Birmingham, a man named Roberson was hit with over 100 tickets due to his personalized plate, while in Wilmington, a motorcyclist named Jim Cara received over 200 tickets for his \"NOTAG\" plate. In Jacksonville, a woman named Carol Schroeder was slapped with 135 tickets worth nearly $8,000 for her \"NOTAG\" plate. These incidents suggest that computer glitches or human errors may be to blame for the unexpected parking ticket notices.", "215": "Despite the NRA's long-standing stance that more guns equal more safety, the organization has banned the carrying of guns from their own national convention in Tennessee. The convention will host 70,000 attendees, but none of them will be allowed to bring their guns, even with proper licenses. The NRA has removed the firing pins from display guns to prevent them from being fired, and attendees who wish to purchase guns will have to do so through a federally licensed dealer. This decision contradicts the NRA's argument that individuals should be able to carry guns for self-defense in public places.", "45": "Despite viral videos and social media claims, Weather Channel meteorologist Mike Seidel was not caught with his pants down during a live report. NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams cleared the record, explaining that Seidel was simply dealing with a loss of communication and was not relieving himself. Williams emphasized that Seidel was the victim of misinformation and social media owes him an apology. The incident was misconstrued as Seidel taking a quick bathroom break, but in reality, he was simply dialing his phone and had not written his name in the snow.", "47": "A TV weatherman was caught with his pants down, literally, while giving an outdoor forecast during a live news broadcast. The weatherman, Mike Seidel, was seen taking a quick pee in the bushes, much to the amusement of the news anchor and viewers. The incident was captured on camera and quickly went viral on social media. However, some critics claimed that Seidel was not urinating, but rather dialing his phone, and that the footage was misleading. Despite these claims, the video evidence appears to support the idea that Seidel was indeed caught in the act of urinating.", "162": "The name of the Moomba festival, held annually in Melbourne, Australia, has been the subject of controversy due to its alleged origins in a derogatory Aboriginal term. According to some sources, the word \"Moomba\" is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning \"buttocks\" or \"anus,\" and was chosen as the name of the festival to convey the idea of \"getting together and having fun.\" However, other sources suggest that the name was chosen without proper consultation with the Aboriginal community, and that the true meaning of the word is not being acknowledged or respected. Despite these concerns, the festival has continued to be celebrated for over 50 years, with the name \"Moomba\" remaining a source of contention and debate.", "194": "While there is an Islamic tribunal operating in the Dallas area that uses Sharia law to settle non-criminal disputes, it does not usurp state or federal law. The tribunal's rulings are non-binding and must be conducted in accordance with U.S. law. Similar religious mediation services exist throughout the U.S. for Christians, Jews, and other religious groups. The tribunal can benefit Muslim women by allowing them to receive a religious divorce, but it is not affiliated with the Islamic Center and has not been endorsed by the city of Irving. However, one Islamic tribunal that uses Sharia as the basis for law has been set up as a non-profit organization in Dallas, and its leader has stated that they follow Sharia law. It remains to be seen how this tribunal operates and whether it is in conflict with Texas law.", "151": "Several studies have investigated the link between abortion and breast cancer risk, with conflicting results. Some studies have found a small increase in breast cancer risk among women who have had an abortion, while others have found no association. However, more recent and well-designed studies have consistently found no evidence that abortion increases breast cancer risk. In fact, the National Cancer Institute has concluded that the current scientific evidence does not support the claim that abortion increases breast cancer risk. The Institute's analysis was based on several large, well-designed studies, including one published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1997. The American Cancer Society also supports this conclusion, stating that the issue has been resolved scientifically and that any suggestion of a link between abortion and breast cancer is a political debate rather than a scientific one.", "164": "Starbucks has been named in a lawsuit against Vermont's GMO labeling regulations, along with Monsanto and other corporations. The lawsuit claims that Vermont's law is unconstitutional and will lead to a 50-state patchwork of GMO labeling policies. However, Starbucks has denied any involvement in the lawsuit and has not taken a position on GMO labeling. The company prefers a national solution to the issue. Despite this, a petition is urging Starbucks to withdraw its support for the lawsuit and allow for accurate food labeling in Vermont.", "163": "According to the documents, the farmer was forced to dump 14% of their tart cherry crop, which is equivalent to 40,000 edible cherries, due to a federal marketing order that aims to stabilize prices and supply in the cherry industry. The order requires processors to keep a certain percentage of the crop off traditional markets to prevent oversupply and maintain prices. The farmer was not allowed to donate or use the dumped cherries in any way, despite having potential buyers. The documents also suggest that the decision to dump the cherries was not due to a personal disagreement with the marketing order, but rather a result of the federal order and the actions of the processor.", "205": "There is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that a massive earthquake will soon hit the west coast based on a carbon monoxide spike. While some sources suggest that high levels of carbon monoxide may be a precursor to earthquakes, there is no established scientific link between the two. In fact, experts have debunked the idea that a carbon monoxide spike can reliably predict earthquakes. Moreover, recent high levels of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere can be attributed to natural causes such as wildfires and surface high pressure, rather than any impending seismic activity. Therefore, it is advisable to rely on established earthquake warning systems and not on unsubstantiated claims based on carbon monoxide readings.", "213": "The Frank family, along with other Jewish refugees, faced significant challenges and restrictions when seeking refuge in the United States during World War II. Otto Frank, Anne's father, filled out numerous application forms and obtained supporting affidavits from relatives in Massachusetts, but the State Department's restrictions against refugees made it difficult for them to secure a visa. Even with powerful connections and money, the family was ultimately denied refugee status. Cuba issued Otto Frank a visa in December 1941, but it was canceled shortly after Germany declared war on the United States. The documents suggest that if the family had sought help sooner, Anne Frank may have been able to escape the Holocaust and live a long life in the United States. However, the Frank family's efforts to secure refugee status were ultimately unsuccessful due to the restrictive immigration policies and the challenges they faced in escaping Nazi-occupied Europe.", "155": "Organ donations can only be made after the donor has been determined to be brain dead, which means they have no chance of recovery and are in a state of irreversible coma. The medical establishment has always been guided by the principle that it is not acceptable to kill someone for their organs, and the use of intravenous medication to paralyze the donor but not anesthetize them is not a viable option. While it is possible to maintain oxygen to the organs through a ventilator after the donor has died, it is not possible to experience pain if the donor has been declared brain dead by the apnea test or other tests. Therefore, the claim that organ donations occur while the donor is still alive, paralyzed by intravenous medication but not anesthetized is not supported by the information provided.", "27": "Contrary to recent reports, there is no evidence to suggest that a bird defecated on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech he gave at the unveiling of a World War I monument in Moscow. Multiple sources, including The Independent and Reddit, have debunked the claim, pointing out that footage of the event shows no signs of any bird droppings on Putin's shoulder. Additionally, photos taken before and after the speech show Putin's suit to be perfectly clean. The video purporting to show the incident appears to be a fake, with the footage of the bird supposedly defecating on Putin edited into the video.", "137": "Former Facebook contractors have admitted to suppressing conservative news stories and injecting liberal content into the trending news module, despite claims of neutrality. The company's guidelines do not permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another, but evidence suggests that conservative viewpoints are being suppressed. The news curation team was instructed to choose articles from preferred media outlets, such as the New York Times and Time, and avoid sites like Breitbart and World Star Hip Hop. Stories from conservative outlets were only included if mainstream sites covered the same stories. These findings suggest that Facebook routinely suppresses conservative news in favor of liberal content.", "196": "According to the first document, a federal Title IX lawsuit filed in Wisconsin, the Kenosha Unified School District instructed a transgender student, Ash Whitaker, to wear a bright green wristband to identify him as transgender. The lawsuit alleges that the school's practice of requiring transgender students to wear the wristband is discriminatory and stigmatizing. The second document states that the student, A.W., felt sickened and afraid when he learned about the school's proposed green wristband practice, fearing that it would out him as transgender and lead to harassment and violence. The third document alleges that the school district has repeatedly refused to recognize or respect A.W.'s gender identity and has taken discriminatory actions against him based on his transgender status. On the other hand, the fourth document states that the Kenosha Unified School District denies having a practice or policy requiring any student to wear a wristband for monitoring purposes. The district's attorney, Ron Stadler, is confident that the district's policies and practices will be found to be in compliance with all laws once the litigation process establishes accurate facts and applies them to the proper legal standards.", "201": "There is limited evidence to support the claim of a new sexual trend called \"sex roulette,\" where one attendee at an orgy is HIV-positive. While some doctors in Barcelona have reported an increase in extreme sex parties where one person is secretly HIV-positive, there is no evidence to suggest that these events are widespread or that they are taking place outside of Spain. Additionally, the report of 25% of new HIV-infected gay men seeking out the virus is based on a single doctor's statement and has been widely debunked. The concept of \"bug chasing\" or intentionally seeking out HIV infection is not supported by hard evidence and is considered an urban legend. Overall, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim of a new sexual trend called \"sex roulette.", "224": "President Obama has been accused of attempting to stop the killing of Osama bin Laden and failing to credit those who accomplished the operation. Documents reveal that Obama was hesitant to authorize the raid and delayed making a decision, with one account stating that he did not leave the golf course until 20 minutes before the SEAL Team 6 operation. Additionally, Obama has been criticized for not properly crediting the Navy SEALs who carried out the operation, instead taking credit for their accomplishment himself. These accounts suggest that Obama may have attempted to stop the killing of bin Laden and failed to properly acknowledge the individuals who successfully carried out the operation.", "150": "Some vaccines contain peanut oil as an adjuvant, a substance that enhances the immune response to the vaccine. Peanut oil has been used in vaccines since the 1960s and is a common trade secret ingredient. However, the use of peanut oil in vaccines has been associated with adverse reactions and potential health risks. Despite this, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have not listed peanut oil as an ingredient in vaccines, and manufacturers are not required to disclose its use. The safety and efficacy of peanut oil in vaccines remain a topic of debate and ongoing research.", "202": "Mississippi has passed a controversial bill that allows churchgoers to shoot and kill citizens at will, under the guise of \"religious freedom\" and \"self-defense\". The \"Mississippi Church Protection Act\" grants churches and their members immunity from civil liability for any actions taken to resist perceived threats, including the use of deadly force. Critics argue that this legislation effectively legalizes vigilante justice and could lead to a rise in violent confrontations and innocent lives lost. Supporters claim that the bill is necessary to protect churches and their congregations from increasing violence and that it aligns with the state's long history of supporting religious freedom. However, the law's vague language and lack of oversight raise concerns about its potential misuse and the risks of unintended consequences.", "198": "According to the documents, top Obama administration officials, including the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, and National Security Team, were aware of the Benghazi attack in real-time and took clear directions to do everything possible to protect Americans. They watched live video footage of the attack and received phone calls from American defenders under siege, but did not intervene. The administration's response was criticized for being too slow, but the documents show that they did not intentionally watch the attack unfold without taking action. The report shifts blame from the President to a rusty bureaucratic process, and the administration's actions were driven by a desire to save lives. Video footage from the consulate and an overhead surveillance drone supported the idea that a military-style assault took place, and the administration studied the footage for clues about the attackers' identities. The Secretary of State and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the deployment of identified assets to try to save lives, and the President made clear that all resources should be used to try to make sure everything possible was done to save lives.", "182": "Swallowing active dry yeast before drinking alcohol may not be an effective way to prevent drunkenness. While one anecdotal account suggests that consuming yeast before drinking beer can help the drinker stay sober, scientific studies suggest that the pH level of the stomach can affect the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and yeast ADH is not active at low pH values. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that yeast has any effect on alcohol tolerance beyond what is already known about the effects of pH on ADH. Therefore, relying on yeast to prevent drunkenness is not a reliable method.", "222": "U.S. troops deployed overseas are no longer receiving hot breakfast due to a change in meal cycles. The change is not due to budget cuts, but rather a responsible drawdown of operational forces. Some bases have switched to providing Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) for breakfast, while others have reduced their overall operations by 40%. The change affects only a few forward operating bases in eastern Afghanistan and does not apply to all troops. Despite the changes, troops are still provided with four meals a day, including a midnight meal, and have access to takeaway items like cereal and granola bars.", "244": "A YouTuber named Josh Paler Lin gave a homeless man $100 and secretly filmed him to see how he would spend the money. Instead of using it on alcohol or drugs, the man used the money to buy food for himself and other homeless people in the area. The man, named Thomas, told Josh that he had lost his parents recently and was struggling to make ends meet. Despite his own difficult situation, Thomas chose to help others with the money he received. The video of Thomas' selfless act has raised over $27,000 for him on IndieGoGo and has gained momentum on social media with the hashtag #letshelpthomas. This story challenges the common stereotype of homeless people being lazy or unwilling to help others, and instead highlights the humanity and compassion of those experiencing homelessness.", "209": "A resident wrote to a newspaper to complain about a fly-by of jets from a local Air Force base, which they believed was a \"wake-up call\" for the community. However, the fly-by was actually a memorial service for a fallen serviceman, Capt. Jeremy Fresques, who had died in Iraq. The Air Force base responded to the resident's letter and explained the significance of the fly-by, stating that it was a display of respect for the fallen serviceman and his family. The base also apologized for any inconvenience or discomfort caused by the noise of the jets. The resident had previously apologized for their letter and expressed their support for the military and their respect for the fallen serviceman.", "174": "The claim that comedian Andy Kaufman is alive, many years after faking his death, has been met with skepticism and conflicting evidence. While a press release from Enrique Proust claimed that Kaufman was alive and well, Proust later admitted to faking the report and apologized for any distress caused. Bob Zmuda, a lifelong friend of Kaufman, stated that if Kaufman were alive, he would know about it, and there has been no evidence to support Proust's claim. Additionally, the woman who claimed to be Kaufman's daughter was identified as a theater student, raising suspicions about her identity. Despite these developments, some believe that Kaufman may have faked his own death and is living in secrecy, but there is currently no concrete evidence to support this theory.", "206": "Doctors question the link between Zika virus and microcephaly in Brazil, suggesting instead that a Monsanto-manufactured pesticide may be responsible. They point to the widespread use of the pesticide in areas with high rates of microcephaly and the lack of cases in areas where the pesticide is not used. The pesticide, Pyriproxyfen, has been linked to malformations in mosquito larvae and has been used in drinking water in affected areas. The doctors demand urgent epidemiological studies to investigate the causal link between the pesticide and microcephaly. However, other sources suggest that the pesticide is safe and has been used in many areas without an increase in microcephaly.", "176": "The documents reveal that the Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT) has been using cameras along highways to monitor traffic flow and detect accidents, but not for law enforcement purposes such as catching speeders. However, the M5 and M7 motorways in Australia have implemented point-to-point speed devices that record the time it takes drivers to travel between two points and issue fines if they exceed the speed limit. Additionally, the Westlink M7 has dismissed a hoax email claiming that the motorway has implemented a secret speed fine based on the time a vehicle enters and exits the motorway, confirming that there is no such system in place. These documents support the claim that states are installing 'point-to-point' cameras to track and ticket speeders based on the amount of time it takes them to travel between two checkpoints.", "141": "There is conflicting information about the red-bellied pacu, an invasive species related to the piranha but with human-like teeth.

The fish is described as a vegetarian species that feeds on seeds and fruits, and there is no record of it attacking humans. However, one person was attacked on his private parts and required medical treatment, and a lady claimed to have been bitten by the pacu on her legs. The investigation revealed that no deaths due to pacu attacks were reported from Korogu to Wagu villages. Overall, the information suggests that while the pacu may be a dangerous species, there is no conclusive evidence that it has bitten off men's testicles and killed anyone.", "212": "Sarah Furay, an 19-year-old college student, was arrested for possessing and manufacturing drugs, but was released on bail after just one day. Her father, Bill Furay, is a DEA agent who has been working in the agency since 2008. The slow pace of the investigation and the fact that Furay only spent one day in jail has led to speculation that her father's connection to the DEA may have influenced the outcome of her case. However, law enforcement officials have stated that the delay in the investigation was due to a backlog in the state lab and not due to any special treatment for Furay. The fact that Furay was finally indicted and charged with four felony counts suggests that the evidence against her was strong and that her father's connection to the DEA did not play a significant role in her avoiding charges.", "214": "Research suggests that a \"abortion pill reversal\" procedure, which involves taking progesterone to counteract the effects of mifepristone, may not be effective in interrupting or undoing a pregnancy termination in progress. Studies have shown that only 30-50% of pregnancies continue after taking mifepristone, and progesterone does not appear to improve the odds of fetal survival. Additionally, there is no research to support the use of progesterone shots to reverse the effects of mifepristone. While some anecdotal evidence suggests that progesterone may help in some cases, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness.", "147": "According to the documents, there is no truth to the belief that rice is harmful to birds. In fact, many birds love rice and it is not a threat to their health. The myth that rice can kill birds likely originated from a bill introduced in the Connecticut legislature in 1985, but there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Experts from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, the Bird House at Lincoln Park Zoo, and the USA Rice Federation have all stated that uncooked rice is not harmful to birds. Furthermore, migrating ducks and geese depend on winter flooded rice fields for food, and uncooked rice is no more harmful to them than rice in the field. Therefore, there is no reason for wedding guests to refrain from throwing rice at newly-wedded couples.", "197": "According to a forensic audio analyst, the chant \"dead cops...now\" was heard during a Black Lives Matter protest in Baton Rouge. However, the authenticity of the video has been questioned, with some suggesting that it may have been edited or manipulated. Additionally, there is evidence that the group responsible for the chant was not part of the main protest and may have been a small, separate group. The use of the phrase \"hands up, shoot back\" and the presence of a banner reading \"No Cops No Prisons\" also suggest a connection to the Trayvon Martin Organizing Committee NYC, which has denied any association with the chant.

In fact, there is no evidence that any flights were delayed or circling due to the haircut. Newsday obtained Federal Aviation Administration records through the Freedom of Information Act that showed no significant delays of regularly scheduled passenger flights, and commuter airlines confirmed they had no record of delays that day. The FAA records showed that an unscheduled air taxi flight had the only delay, and it was only two minutes late. The claim that planes were kept circling while President Clinton got his haircut is false.", "323": "A Florida massage therapist named Jasmine Tridevil recently made headlines for claiming to have undergone surgery to get a third breast implanted. However, evidence suggests that the entire story may be a hoax. A stolen luggage report from the Tampa International Airport lists a \"3 breast prosthesis\" among Tridevil's belongings, and a police report states that the \"third breast\" is actually a prosthetic. Additionally, the surgeon who performed the surgery could not create a silicone areola, and instead tattooed one onto the implant. Tridevil's motivation for the surgery was reportedly to become \"unattractive to men\" and gain fame, but her parents are displeased with the outcome. The claim of three boobs is therefore likely two boobs and a lie.", "267": "Christian Bale was initially cast as Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, but he has since withdrawn from the role.

Additionally, the school's FAQ stated that the play was canceled due to the inordinate amount of class time taken up by rehearsals. While some parents had requested that their child be excused from the play, there is no evidence to suggest that any parents complained about the play's content or the reference to God.

Another study found that non-citizen voting is extremely rare and could not account for Clinton's popular vote margin.
