{"173": "The computer salami technique allows an embezzler to divert small sums of money from many accounts at once, building a substantial sum over time. In the documented cases, the criminals were programmers who knew how to manipulate their company's or bank's computers to steal from employees, customers, or even the IRS. These criminals stole small amounts at a time, usually less than a dollar, and did so sparingly so as not to arouse suspicion. The criminals then transferred the stolen money into dummy accounts, which they controlled. In some cases, the criminals received the stolen money in the form of tax refunds, with the IRS acting as an unwitting intermediary. The documents support the claim that a bank employee could embezzle a large amount of money by stealing small sums from many different accounts.", "143": "The claim that cheap soy sauce is made from the hair of Chinese convicts has not been substantiated. However, there are reports of faked soy sauce being made in China using amino acid syrups. In 2004, Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department found over two hundred bottles of faked soy sauce labelled under a popular local brand. A Chinese television program investigated the production of Hongshuai Soy Sauce and found that it was made from amino acid syrup mixed with water, sodium hydroxide, red sugar, hydrochloric acid, and other chemical additives. An investigation revealed that human hair, from barber shop floors, hospitals, and salons, was being used to make amino acid powder or syrup in China's Hubei Province. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the hair used was from Chinese convicts.", "200": "After Hillary Clinton refused to participate in a final debate, GOP candidate Donald Trump agreed to debate the democratic challenger Bernie Sanders. Trump said that he would love to debate Sanders in a large arena and to raise money for charity, including women's health issues. Trump's openness to the debate could be a win-win proposition, as it puts likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a bind. However, Clinton's top campaign spokeswoman said Clinton will not debate Sanders in California. Trump also said that it seems inappropriate that he would debate the second place finisher, and he will wait to debate the first place finisher in the Democratic Party. The networks are not proving to be too generous to charitable causes, in this case, women's health issues.", "217": "The claim that TSA confiscated nail clippers from a U.S. soldier returning from Afghanistan on a flight full of armed soldiers is not accurate. Nail clippers have never been prohibited by TSA. The facility where military charters are processed at Indianapolis International Airport is run by the National Guard, and TSA staff does not have access to this facility. Military charters arrive at the remote transit terminal, and TSA staff does not conduct any screening operations there. The story of TSA confiscating nail clippers from soldiers is unattributed and has been denied by the National Guard. TSA has allowed nail clippers on flights since its inception.", "187": "The cone shaped skulls that have been found in Latin America are often cited as evidence of alien life. However, DNA testing of these skulls has produced results that are consistent with human DNA, but have unknown mutations. These mutations could suggest that the skulls are of a different type of being. However, the DNA testing is not conclusive and requires further study. Experts suggest that the cone shaped skulls found in Latin America could be due to a tradition in the tribes that lived in the area. Other evidence, such as the age of the remains, also supports the conclusion that the cone shaped skulls are of human origin. Overall, the evidence does not support the claim that the cone shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien origin.", "179": "CFL light bulbs do emit higher levels of electromagnetic fields and ultraviolet radiation than incandescent bulbs. However, the levels of both types of radiation are very low and do not pose a health risk to the general population. EMF drops off sharply with distance, and additional glass or plastic covers on CFL bulbs further reduce the already low levels of UV radiation. According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence confirming a link between symptoms such as headaches, anxiety, and depression and low-level exposure to electromagnetic fields. Therefore, the claim that CFL light bulbs are dangerous compared to conventional incandescent bulbs because they emit higher levels of radiation is not supported by the evidence.", "149": "Dorothy Dandridge, a black entertainer, was not allowed to use the swimming pool of the Last Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas during her performances there in the 1950s. The hotel management drained the pool after she deliberately dipped her foot in it, causing complaints from white patrons. This incident highlights the racial prejudice faced by black entertainers in Las Vegas during that time. The hotel allowed Dandridge to stay in one of its luxury suites only after her manager, Earl Mills, insisted. However, she was still subjected to racist policies that prohibited her from using the pool and staying in the hotels where she performed.", "193": "The Starr Report in 1998 contains DNA data that can be used to rule out paternity. A tabloid, The Star, paid Bobbie Ann Williams, the mother of Danney Williams, for her story and blood samples. The result of the DNA test does not support the claim as there was no match between Bill Clinton and Danney Williams. A former prostitute, Bobbie Ann Williams, claimed that she had a sexual relationship with Bill Clinton in 1984, resulting in the birth of Danney Williams. However, DNA evidence does not support this claim. Dr. George Riley of Genelex calculated that the genetic fingerprint given in the Starr report would yield a paternity index of only 20 to 30, which is not enough to prove paternity. The legal threshold is 100, and the actual value depends on the mother's DNA. Therefore, the DNA evidence does not support the claim that Bill Clinton fathered an illegitimate, mixed-race son named Danney Williams with an Arkansas prostitute in 1985.", "208": "The remains of more than 250 soldiers were disposed of in a landfill between 2003 and 2008, according to Air Force officials. The practice included cremating body parts and dumping the ashes in a Virginia landfill. Mortuary leaders decided to end the practice in May 2008 as they found a better way to do it. Families of the soldiers were not informed about the disposal of their loved ones' remains. The practice was acknowledged by the Air Force in response to inquiries from The Washington Post in 2011. The procedure was limited to fragments or portions of body parts that were unable to be identified at first or were later recovered from the battlefield, and which family members had said could be disposed of by the military. The remains were cremated, then incinerated, and then taken to a landfill by a military contractor. The practice was similar to the disposal of medical waste. The procedure was carried out during a time when the mortuary was shielded from public scrutiny, as news coverage of the return of fallen troops to Dover was banned by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 and remained until April 2009.", "175": "A man whose car bears personalized license plates reading 'NO PLATE' receives notices for thousands of unpaid parking tickets. This situation has happened to other people as well. One person had 'NO TAG' on his car and received over 200 parking violation notices. Another person with 'NOTAG' on her car received notices for 135 parking tickets totaling almost $8,000. When Birmingham parking patrols find cars without license plates parked illegally, they enter seven X's in place of the plate number. The parking citation form calls for a plate number, and the practice is to use X's when no number is available. However, computers talking to state Division of Motor Vehicles computers had found an address for ticketed vehicles that lacked license tags, resulting in the notices being sent to the owner of the car with the 'NO TAG' plate.", "142": "Kellogg's was initially rumored to have added traces of peanut flour to Nutri Grain Apple Cobbler Fruit Crunch Bars, but it turned out that the product had already been discontinued. However, the company has acknowledged adding peanut flour to Keebler and Austin sandwich crackers, explaining that it ensures allergen preventative controls are in place where appropriate and complies with FDA regulations issued under FSMA. However, speculation arises that Kellogg's is adding minute quantities of peanut flour to avoid the complications of complying with the new FSMA directives that go into effect this September. This could make their products more allergenic instead of safer, but Kellogg's has not issued any press release to clarify their decision.", "180": "Buffalo Police Commissioner issued an alert warning drivers about a possible gang initiation ruse where individuals wanting to join gangs cause a rear-end collision and then attack the driver. The alert was based on a shooting incident this month involving a man who was shot after pulling over when a vehicle behind him, occupied by at least three men, began flashing its lights at him. The police believe the gang is making its first stop in Western New York and has a reputation for violence to citizens and law enforcement. However, other law enforcement agencies in different states have dismissed similar claims as an urban legend, stating they have no credible information to substantiate them.

In France, these areas are referred to as 'sensitive urban zones'. While in normal times, they are unthreatening and routine places, it is advised to exercise caution when entering these areas. In Birmingham, England, the Prime Minister described the city as a fantastic example of bringing people together of different faiths and backgrounds and building a strong economy. An American \"terrorism expert\" claimed that Birmingham is a Muslim only city and that non Muslims simply don\u2019t go there. The expert later apologized for these claims.

The news channel later issued an apology for these claims.", "146": "Menstrual synchrony is a popular belief, but there is little scientific evidence to support it. Studies have shown that the decrease in onset differences over time can be attributed to chance factors rather than synchronization. Theories suggesting that synchrony would maximize reproductive success have been disproven by research on primate species. A meta-analysis found that dominant males had less control over reproduction when females synchronized their cycles, contradicting the notion that synchrony would enable females to engage in polyandry. A study of Clue users found that only 79 out of 360 pairs of women had a narrowing gap between cycle start dates, while 273 pairs had a larger difference. The mean differences observed for all comparisons were close to the expected mean difference of 7.5 days. The paucity of evidence suggests that the belief in menstrual synchrony may arise from a misconception about how far apart onset dates would be expected to be by chance alone.", "215": "The NRA has not banned the carrying of guns from their national convention in Tennessee.

These panels, which operate in Dallas and Irving, prevent private matters from turning into expensive, public affairs and are based on Islamic principles. The rulings are non-binding and work within the guidelines of U.S. law. The imams that run the panels do not usurp state or federal law. However, a few Republican lawmakers have tried to pass bills targeting these tribunals, arguing that Sharia law is creeping into the U.S. legal system. But they do so without any evidence that Sharia Law is causing an issue in their district. The tribunals can benefit Muslim women by allowing them to receive a religious divorce. A women can receive a divorce from a U.S. civil court, but if she wants to remarry in the faith, then a religious divorce is warranted. In cases where the husband does not want to grant a divorce, a Muslim woman can make a case to a tribunal, but they are not always granted.

The unwritten rule in transplant practice is that the donor must die of some other cause before his organs can be removed. The donor is determined to be dead before organs can be removed, and this can occur through two methods: heart beating or non heart beating. In non heart beating donation, the patient is not brain death and parts of his brain still work. The patient is kept sedated and intubated, and if he dies within 2 hours after withdrawing care, the body will be moved to the OR to remove the organs for donation. In heart beating donation, the patient is brain death and cannot suffer or feel pain. Brain dead individuals are in a state of irreversible coma, will never regain consciousness or have a meaningful recovery, and can not experience pain. The sensation of pain requires upper level brain function, and brain dead individuals do not have this function.

The order is enforced by the growers themselves for the betterment of the industry. The farmer's claim that he is not allowed to donate or use the dumped cherries in any way is not true.

The adoption ceremony, which was introduced in 1907, aims to counteract the stigma and provide the child with a godparent, a gold medal, and a full educational scholarship.

Elanco has reviewed the reports and found no established link between the pill and any dog fatalities. The reports of deaths are similar to other products dispensed for heartworm prevention. There have been no significant changes in reporting rate from year to year over the life of the product. The data suggests it's unlikely there was any connection to the product in the pet's unfortunate passing. However, some pet owners claim that their dogs died after taking Trifexis.

The legend of the \u2018lobiz\u00f3n\u2019 or werewolf is connected to the tradition, and according to the legend, the seventh son of the seventh son is meant to become a werewolf. However, technically, Yair was safe from becoming a werewolf as he was not the seventh son of the seventh son. It is the seventh son of the seventh son that is considered to have the curse.

However, this claim is false. The truth is that Tawil was adopted by the President as part of a century-old tradition where every seventh child born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the president's godchild. This practice originated from Czarist Russia. The confusion arose because of the legend of the lobiz\u00f3n, Argentina's equivalent to the European werewolf, which is not related to the tradition.

This tradition is not related to the superstition that the seventh son of a family will turn into a werewolf. However, some media reports have confused the two and claimed that the adoption of the seventh son is to prevent him from becoming a werewolf. The recent adoption of a Jewish boy as a godchild by the Argentine president is one such example. The boy's parents had written to the president in 1993, but the adoption was only completed in 2014, during Hanukkah. The adoption was a \"magical moment\" for the president, and the boy received a gold medal and an educational scholarship.

According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf upon his 13th birthday. The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons. The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.

The tradition involves the president adopting the seventh son or daughter of a family as a godchild, which began in 1907 and was established in 1973. It was extended to other religions in 2009. Tawil\u2019s family had written to the president in 1993 requesting that he becomes a godchild, and he was accepted this year.
