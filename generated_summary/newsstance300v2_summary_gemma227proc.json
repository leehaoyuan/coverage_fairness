{"173": "A common method of embezzlement involves stealing small amounts from numerous accounts. This can be achieved by exploiting computer systems to round down transactions, diverting the fractions to a hidden account. The perpetrator might also manipulate payroll systems, subtly increasing withholdings from multiple employees and redirecting the excess to their own accounts. These small, seemingly insignificant thefts accumulate over time, potentially resulting in substantial gains for the embezzler while remaining undetected by both the institution and the victims. The anonymity provided by large numbers of accounts and the inconspicuous nature of the thefts make this a highly effective method of embezzlement.", "143": "There are claims circulating that cheap soy sauce is made from human hair. Some reports suggest that amino acid syrup, derived from human hair, is used in the production of certain soy sauces. This practice was allegedly exposed by journalists investigating a Chinese soy sauce manufacturer. They discovered that the manufacturer purchased large quantities of amino acid syrup, which was reportedly made from human hair collected from various sources. While some manufacturers may have discontinued this practice due to public pressure and government bans, concerns remain about the origin of ingredients in some soy sauce products.", "200": "Donald Trump expressed interest in debating Bernie Sanders, suggesting it would be a high-ratings event and proposing a charitable contribution as a condition. He believed such a debate would put Hillary Clinton in a difficult position as she had declined to debate Sanders before the California primary. However, Trump later stated that he would wait to debate the Democratic frontrunner, likely Hillary Clinton, deeming it inappropriate to debate the second-place finisher in a rigged system. This followed Hillary Clinton's campaign's announcement that she would not be participating in any further debates with Sanders, focusing instead on campaigning and preparing for the general election.", "217": "There are conflicting accounts regarding TSA confiscation of nail clippers from soldiers returning from Afghanistan. One account claims that TSA agents confiscated nail clippers and multi-tools from soldiers, despite the soldiers carrying military-issued firearms. However, another account, backed by the Indiana National Guard, states that TSA personnel do not have access to the facility where military charters are processed and therefore could not have confiscated any items. Additionally, it is stated that nail clippers have never been prohibited by TSA, although there was a brief period after 9/11 when they were banned.", "187": "Some claim that cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien origin due to unusual genetic mutations found in samples. These mutations, they argue, suggest a \"human-like being\" distinct from known hominids. However, others counter that the DNA evidence is inconclusive and could be attributed to contamination or defects in the testing process. They emphasize the need for further study. Additionally, archaeologists propose that the skull shape is a result of cultural practices, citing evidence of intentional cranial deformation among ancient populations. This practice, they suggest, served social and survival purposes, promoting group cohesion and signaling trustworthiness.", "142": "There is conflicting information regarding Kellogg's addition of peanut flour to its products. Some sources claim that Kellogg's is intentionally adding traces of peanut flour to various products, including Keebler and Austin crackers, and potentially others, to avoid complying with new FSMA regulations. They suggest this is a cost-saving measure that undermines the intent of the FSMA, which aims to enhance food safety for allergic individuals. However, Kellogg's denies these allegations, stating that food safety is a top priority and that they fully comply with FSMA regulations, including allergen control measures. They emphasize their commitment to preventing allergen cross-contamination and ensuring accurate labeling.", "179": "While CFLs emit higher levels of EMF in certain frequencies than incandescent bulbs, there is no evidence that this poses any health risks. EMF levels decrease significantly with distance, rendering the concern about proximity irrelevant.  CFLs also have a built-in UV filtering effect, and additional covers can further reduce UV exposure. Research suggests that CFLs do not pose a significant risk of acute injury to the eyes or skin compared to incandescent bulbs. While some people fear health consequences from low-level electromagnetic fields emitted by CFLs, extensive scientific evidence does not support these claims.", "149": "In the 1950s, Dorothy Dandridge faced severe racial discrimination in Las Vegas, despite her status as a renowned entertainer. While she was allowed to perform at prestigious hotels, she was barred from accessing their facilities, including swimming pools. It is widely recounted that one hotel took the extreme measure of draining its pool after Dandridge dipped her toe in the water, highlighting the pervasive racism of the era. This incident, though upsetting, did not deter Dandridge from pursuing her career, and she continued to gain recognition for her talent.", "175": "People who have personalized license plates reading \"NO PLATE,\" \"NOTAG,\" or similar variations have experienced receiving numerous parking tickets that were intended for vehicles without license plates. The computer systems used by parking enforcement officials often default to entering \"NO TAG\" or \"XXXXXXX\" when a license plate is missing. Consequently, tickets issued to cars without plates are mistakenly assigned to vehicles with these personalized plates. This has resulted in individuals receiving hundreds or even thousands of dollars in fines for parking violations they did not commit.", "180": "There have been reports circulating about a dangerous gang initiation ritual involving rear-end collisions. Some reports suggest that gang members intentionally bump into cars and then attack the driver when they exit the vehicle. These reports have led to public alerts and warnings from law enforcement officials. However, other reports have dismissed these claims as urban legends, stating that there is no credible evidence to support them. While some officials cite specific incidents and \"credible information\" as justification for the warnings, others maintain that the threat is unfounded.", "208": "Between 2003 and 2008, portions of unidentified or unclaimed remains of troops were cremated and disposed of in a landfill. This practice was stopped in 2008 and replaced with burial at sea. The military maintained that families had consented to this method of disposal, as they had signed forms allowing the military to make \"appropriate disposition\" of any additional remains. While the practice was not publicly disclosed, it was not entirely ignored by the media, as The Washington Post reported on it in 2011.  The lack of media coverage during the initial years of the practice may have been due to a ban on news coverage of the return of fallen troops, which was in place from 1991 until 2009.", "193": "A tabloid claimed that Bill Clinton fathered a son named Danney Williams with a prostitute in 1985. The tabloid paid for DNA tests and interviews with the mother and son. However, DNA analysis, though initially inconclusive, ultimately ruled out Clinton as the father. The mother claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Clinton, but this account was disputed. While initial genetic fingerprinting tests were imprecise, further analysis using more specific data ultimately excluded Clinton as the father. Despite the tabloid's initial pursuit of the story, scientific evidence ultimately debunked the claim.", "146": "While some evolutionary arguments suggest that menstrual synchrony could benefit females, empirical evidence for this phenomenon is limited. Studies analyzing menstrual cycles of women living or working in close proximity have yielded mixed results. Some research found that cycle onset differences between pairs of women actually increased over time, while others observed no statistically significant changes. Furthermore, the observed average difference in cycle start dates aligns with the expected difference by chance alone. This suggests that the belief in menstrual synchrony may be driven by confirmation bias rather than actual biological synchronization.", "219": "There is conflicting information regarding the existence of \"no-go zones\" in Europe and the United States. Some accounts describe certain areas with high Muslim populations as \"sensitive urban zones\" that experience occasional unrest but are generally safe. Others dismiss claims of \"no-go zones\" as inaccurate and offensive, emphasizing the diversity and inclusivity of cities like Birmingham. Some reports suggest the existence of areas with intense Muslim density where Sharia law is allegedly enforced and police presence is limited, effectively creating \"countries within countries.\" However, these claims are contradicted by statements clarifying that there are no formal designations of such zones and no credible evidence to support their existence.", "47": "There is a viral video circulating online that appears to show a weatherman urinating on camera during a live broadcast. The footage shows the weatherman standing with his back to the camera in a position that suggests he might be relieving himself. However, the weatherman's network has denied these claims, stating that he was actually attempting to contact the control room after losing communication. They explain that the weatherman was hunched over, dialing his phone, and not engaging in any inappropriate behavior. Social media users who initially spread the rumor have been urged to apologize for spreading misinformation.", "45": "There are conflicting accounts regarding whether Mike Seidel was caught urinating on camera. Some reports claim he was hunched over dialing his phone after losing contact with the control room, explaining his awkward position. Others suggest he was caught relieving himself, with one report even mentioning him zipping up his pants and putting his gloves back on. There are also claims that he was simply not ready for his segment and muttered \"why\" when prompted. The conflicting information leaves the situation ambiguous, with no definitive proof to confirm or deny the claim.", "215": "There is conflicting information regarding whether the NRA banned guns at their convention. Some sources claim the NRA prohibited attendees from carrying guns, citing the removal of firing pins from display weapons and the organization's preference for attendees to leave their guns at home. They argue this contradicts the NRA's stance on \"good guys with guns\" and gun safety. However, other sources state that attendees with proper licenses are permitted to carry firearms in accordance with Tennessee law, except at Bridgestone Arena where guns are prohibited. They explain that the removal of firing pins from display guns is a standard safety practice at such events and that gun sales involve background checks conducted by licensed dealers.", "164": "There are conflicting claims regarding Starbucks' involvement in a lawsuit against Vermont's GMO labeling law. Some sources allege that Starbucks, alongside Monsanto, is part of a lawsuit aiming to block the law, arguing that it violates their right to free speech and constitutes an assault on corporate interests. They claim that Starbucks is hiding behind the Grocery Manufacturers Association to avoid transparency about GMO ingredients in their products. However, Starbucks denies these allegations, stating they are not involved in any lawsuit related to GMO labeling and have not funded any such campaigns. They emphasize a preference for a national solution to the issue and deny any alignment with Monsanto.", "162": "The origin of the name \"Moomba\" for Melbourne's annual festival is disputed. While some claim it means \"Let's get together and have fun,\" others assert it is a derogatory Aboriginal term. Evidence suggests the word \"Moom\" translates to \"buttocks\" or \"anus\" in several Victorian Koori languages, with \"ba\" meaning \"at,\" \"in,\" or \"on.\" This combination leads to a less flattering interpretation of the festival's name. The festival's organizers, however, maintain the positive translation, seemingly unaware of the alternative meaning.  It is suggested that the name was deliberately chosen as a joke, with the Aboriginal community finding humor in the situation.", "163": "A Michigan farmer's claim of being forced to destroy 40,000 edible cherries due to imported competition is misleading. While the marketing order does require processors to remove a percentage of cherries from traditional markets, this is done to stabilize prices and supply, which have been historically volatile. Farmers can utilize surplus cherries through various means, including freezing, drying, or selling them in overseas markets. Donation is also an option, though tart cherries, with their short shelf life, are typically used in processed products. The claim that farmers are prohibited from using or donating surplus cherries is false.", "194": "An Islamic tribunal operates in the Dallas area, offering a forum for Muslims to settle disputes according to Islamic principles. The tribunal emphasizes that its rulings are non-binding and must adhere to U.S. law.  While proponents argue that it provides a valuable service for the Muslim community, particularly in matters like religious divorce, critics raise concerns about the potential conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. The tribunal claims that Sharia and Texas law are largely aligned, but acknowledges that individuals can seek redress in Texas civil courts if they disagree with a ruling. However, the potential social consequences of rejecting a tribunal decision remain unclear.", "205": "While some claim that a spike in carbon monoxide levels could be a precursor to earthquakes, this notion is disputed. Some argue that elevated carbon monoxide readings are due to pollution from wildfires and industrial emissions, not seismic activity. They point to the fact that carbon monoxide levels fluctuate naturally and are not consistently linked to earthquakes. Furthermore, experts emphasize that there is no scientific consensus on reliable earthquake prediction methods, and claims linking carbon monoxide spikes to earthquakes are often based on outdated or unsubstantiated research.", "155": "While the concept of organ donation necessitates the donor's death, there are ongoing debates regarding the precise moment of death determination. Traditionally, organ donation required the complete cessation of brain function, confirming the donor's legal death. However, advancements in medical technology, particularly ventilators, have introduced complexities. Some argue that maintaining organ viability through ventilation after brain death raises ethical considerations. Furthermore, there are cases where organ donation occurs after withdrawing life support from individuals who are not technically brain dead but have suffered irreversible brain damage and are unlikely to regain consciousness. In these instances, sedation and pain management are administered to minimize suffering.", "150": "Peanut oil has been used as an ingredient in some vaccines, particularly flu shots, since the 1960s. While some argue that it's a \"secret\" ingredient not listed due to being present in \"trace amounts,\" others maintain that its presence is a deliberate omission to conceal its potential allergenic effects. Research has explored various oil-based adjuvants, including peanut oil emulsions, but concerns about reactogenicity and potential carcinogenicity have led to the discontinuation of some formulations. Despite this, the use of peanut oil in vaccines, though not always disclosed, has been documented in scientific literature and patent filings.", "151": "While some studies suggest a potential link between induced abortion and breast cancer risk, particularly those relying on self-reported data, these findings are often challenged by methodological issues like reporting bias. Larger, more rigorous studies, including one published in the New England Journal of Medicine, have consistently failed to establish a causal relationship between abortion and increased breast cancer risk. Major health organizations like the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have concluded, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that induced abortion does not increase the risk of developing breast cancer.", "27": "A video circulating online appeared to show a bird defecating on Vladimir Putin during a speech at a World War I monument unveiling. However, this video has been debunked as fake. Other footage and photographs from the event show no evidence of the incident. The alleged bird droppings are absent in these alternate recordings, indicating that the viral video was manipulated. Therefore, the claim that a bird pooped on Vladimir Putin during his speech is false.", "213": "Anne Frank's family desperately sought refuge in the United States. Otto Frank, Anne's father, diligently pursued visas, filling out applications and securing affidavits from relatives. He even reached out to influential contacts like Nathan Straus Jr. Despite their efforts, the family faced significant obstacles. The United States imposed stringent restrictions on refugees, particularly those with relatives in Nazi-occupied Europe. These restrictions, coupled with the outbreak of war, ultimately thwarted their attempts to escape. A visa granted by Cuba was canceled after Germany declared war on the US. The family's tragic fate highlights the immense challenges faced by Jewish refugees during this period.", "201": "There are reports of a disturbing trend called \"sex roulette\" where individuals, often gay men, engage in orgies with one person secretly HIV-positive. This practice is said to offer a thrill from the risk of infection. Some claim these parties are becoming increasingly common, with attendees taking antiviral drugs to reduce transmission risk. However, there are doubts about the prevalence of this trend. Critics point out the logistical difficulties of ensuring a secret HIV-positive participant and the lack of substantial evidence beyond anecdotal reports from a few doctors and therapists. The claim of a widespread trend is also challenged by the absence of concrete data and the potential for sensationalism in media coverage.", "196": "A lawsuit alleges that a Wisconsin school district instructed guidance counselors to have transgender students wear bright green wristbands to monitor their restroom usage. The lawsuit claims this practice would make transgender students vulnerable to harassment and ridicule. The student who brought the lawsuit felt sickened and afraid at the prospect of being singled out. The school district denies the allegation, stating they have no policy requiring wristbands for any purpose and have worked to accommodate the needs of transgender students. They are confident their practices comply with all laws.", "137": "There are allegations that Facebook workers suppressed conservative news stories from the trending news section, favoring mainstream outlets over conservative sources like Breitbart and The Blaze. Former curators claim they were instructed to inject selected stories into the trending module, even if they weren't organically trending, and avoid mentioning Twitter by name. They also stated that conservative stories were excluded unless covered by mainstream outlets. However, some curators denied conscious suppression of conservative news, and there is no evidence that Facebook management mandated any political bias. Facebook itself denies any suppression, stating they have rigorous guidelines against prioritizing one viewpoint over another and are conducting a full investigation into the allegations.", "224": "There are conflicting accounts regarding President Obama's role in the operation to kill Osama bin Laden. Some portray him as a decisive leader who bravely authorized the raid despite uncertainty, praising his leadership and the national security team's efforts. They highlight his recognition and praise for the SEAL team responsible for the operation. Conversely, others allege that he attempted to delay or stop the mission and only took credit after its success. They criticize his perceived lack of involvement during the operation, citing his delayed arrival to the situation room and attire as evidence.", "202": "Mississippi has passed a bill, the \"Mississippi Church Protection Act,\" that allows churches to establish security programs with armed members. These members are granted immunity from civil liability for actions taken while on duty, including the use of deadly force to protect the congregation. The bill expands concealed carry rights and allows for justifiable homicide claims for security team members who kill while acting in their official capacity. Critics argue that this effectively legalizes \"soldiers of God\" and grants churches the power to act as their own sovereign entities, above the law.", "182": "There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that consuming active dry yeast before drinking alcohol might prevent intoxication. Some individuals claim to experience minimal effects from alcohol after ingesting yeast. However, scientific evidence contradicts this claim. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down alcohol, is inactive in the acidic environment of the stomach. Therefore, it is unlikely that yeast ingested orally would effectively metabolize alcohol before it is absorbed into the bloodstream. While yeast may have other effects, relying on it to prevent drunkenness is not scientifically supported.", "206": "There is a debate surrounding the cause of the increased microcephaly cases in Brazil. Some doctors, particularly those associated with groups campaigning against pesticides, argue that the use of the Monsanto-manufactured pesticide Pyriproxyfen, added to drinking water to control mosquito populations, is responsible. They point to the concentration of cases in areas where the pesticide was used and the lack of similar increases in places where the pesticide is also used. However, others argue that the Zika virus is the more likely culprit, citing the virus's known link to microcephaly and the fact that the pesticide is used in other areas without a surge in microcephaly cases.", "214": "There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of progesterone in reversing the effects of mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug abortion regimen. Some argue that progesterone may compete with mifepristone for progesterone receptors, potentially reversing its effects. However, research suggests that a significant percentage of women who take only mifepristone will not miscarry, and progesterone may not significantly improve the odds of fetal survival. While anecdotal reports exist of successful pregnancies after progesterone administration following mifepristone, these cases lack robust scientific backing.", "198": "There is conflicting information regarding the actions of top Obama administration officials during the Benghazi attack. While some reports suggest that officials watched live video of the attack but did not intervene, others state that the president ordered the use of all available resources to save lives and directed the immediate deployment of assets. Video footage from the consulate and a surveillance drone shows a well-organized attack, while a report claims that bureaucratic processes and the low alert status of forces contributed to delays in response. Despite these delays, the administration insists that orders were given to deploy forces immediately to Benghazi.", "189": "Typically, politically appointed ambassadors submit their resignations at the end of a presidential term, but the incoming administration may grant extensions on a case-by-case basis. This time, however, a blanket edict was issued requiring all politically appointed ambassadors to leave their posts by Inauguration Day without exceptions. This decision breaks with decades of precedent, as previous administrations often allowed some ambassadors to remain for a short period after the inauguration. This hard-line approach leaves the United States without confirmed envoys in crucial countries for potentially months. While some argue that this is standard procedure, the lack of flexibility and the blanket nature of the order represent a significant departure from past practices.", "212": "Sarah Furay, a 19-year-old woman, was arrested for possession and distribution of drugs. Her initial release after only one day in jail and the delay in charges led to speculation that her father's position as a DEA agent granted her special treatment. However, authorities explained the delay was due to backlogs at state crime labs responsible for analyzing the evidence. After a year, Furay was indicted on four felony drug charges, including possession with intent to deliver cocaine, methamphetamine, and LSD, as well as possession of marijuana. This suggests that despite initial speculation, Furay ultimately faced legal consequences for her alleged crimes.", "174": "There are conflicting accounts regarding Andy Kaufman's alleged faked death. One source claims a press release announcing his return was a hoax perpetrated by an individual seeking to perpetuate Kaufman's legacy. This individual has since apologized and retracted his claims. Another source suggests Kaufman orchestrated a complex scheme involving a body double and a staged death to escape public life. This theory hinges on Kaufman's supposed 30-year plan for his return, which has yet to materialize. Additionally, a woman claiming to be Kaufman's daughter has emerged, raising questions about the timeline and authenticity of her claims.", "222": "There are conflicting reports regarding the availability of breakfast for U.S. troops deployed overseas. Some reports indicate that hot breakfast has been replaced with MREs at certain bases in Afghanistan, particularly those undergoing closure or transfer to Afghan forces. This change is attributed to logistical streamlining rather than budget cuts, with assurances that troops still receive four meals per day, including hot lunches and dinners. Other reports suggest that breakfast is being eliminated entirely at some bases due to budget constraints, leaving soldiers with only MREs for breakfast. These reports cite emails and personal accounts from soldiers who claim they are only able to access one hot meal per day due to their work schedules.", "209": "A resident wrote a letter to the newspaper complaining about a morning flyby of jets, describing it as an unnecessary \"wake up call\" and questioning the motives of the pilots. The resident later issued an apology, explaining that they were unaware of the significance of the flyby. It was revealed that the flyby was a formation of F-16 jets from a local Air Force base honoring a fallen Air Force captain who had died in Iraq. The flyby was part of a memorial service held for the captain at his gravesite. The Air Force emphasized that the flyby was a respectful tribute to the deceased officer and a way to honor his sacrifice.", "147": "There is a widespread belief that throwing rice at weddings harms birds because uncooked rice expands in their stomachs, leading to death. However, this claim is disputed by ornithologists and bird experts. They argue that birds have powerful gizzards that can grind food, including rice, and that many birds actually consume rice in their natural habitats without any ill effects. Some experts even suggest that rice is a natural food source for certain bird species. While a legislator proposed a bill to ban rice throwing at weddings based on this belief, the scientific community largely refutes the notion that rice is harmful to birds.", "197": "A video circulating online appears to show a group chanting \"What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!\" The video was reportedly filmed in Baton Rouge, but the authenticity of the recording has been questioned. Some argue the audio is doctored, while others claim the group chanting was not part of the main Black Lives Matter protest.  A forensic audio analyst, however, maintains the chants are clearly audible in the recording. The group chanting \"dead cops\" also used the slogan \"arms up, shoot back!\", which is associated with a group called the Trayvon Martin Organizing Committee.", "141": "Reports regarding the red-bellied pacu biting off men's testicles and causing fatalities are conflicting. While some reports mention incidents of men being attacked and suffering injuries to their genitals, these reports are often based on hearsay and lack concrete evidence. Investigations have failed to confirm any deaths directly attributed to pacu attacks. Experts emphasize that pacus are primarily vegetarian and their teeth are designed for crushing seeds and nuts, not tearing flesh. While pacus may bite defensively if provoked, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that they target testicles or have killed anyone.", "195": "Initial reports claimed that President Clinton's haircut on Air Force One at LAX caused significant flight delays, with planes circling and runways backed up. This narrative fueled criticism and became a symbol of perceived White House arrogance. However, subsequent investigations, including FAA records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that these reports were inaccurate. The records showed that only one air taxi experienced a minor two-minute delay, and no planes were forced to circle. FAA officials confirmed that the closure of two runways did not cause any significant disruptions to air traffic due to light traffic that afternoon.", "244": "A YouTuber, known for pranks, gave a homeless man $100 and secretly filmed him to see how he would spend it. The YouTuber expected the man to buy alcohol but was surprised when he saw the man buy food and share it with other homeless people. The man explained that there are things money can't buy and that helping others brings him happiness. Touched by the man's actions, the YouTuber gave him an additional $100. This act of kindness has inspired many, with the video raising over $130,000 for homeless people. However, an eyewitness claims to have seen the YouTuber and the homeless man together before filming, suggesting the encounter may have been staged.", "176": "There are conflicting reports regarding the use of point-to-point speed cameras on highways. While some claim that these systems are being implemented, citing examples of cameras and e-tag systems used to calculate travel time and issue speeding tickets, others deny their existence.

Bush won the 2000 election. Some reports claim that actor Alec Baldwin vowed to leave, a statement his wife Kim Basinger seemingly corroborated. However, Baldwin vehemently denies making such a promise, attributing the confusion to a possible mix-up with director Robert Altman, who publicly stated his intention to move to France if Bush won. Altman later retracted his statement, claiming he meant to say he would move to Paris, Texas. Despite the denials, Baldwin's strong opposition to Bush's policies fueled speculation about his potential departure.", "356": "There was speculation online that NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel was caught urinating on camera during a live broadcast.

However, Edible Arrangements vehemently denies these claims, stating they have no evidence to support them and that the company has denounced terrorism.

A police report revealed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" was found in her stolen luggage, suggesting the third breast was a prosthetic rather than surgically implanted. Snopes.com also investigated and found inconsistencies in her story, pointing towards a potential hoax.", "303": "The President of Argentina has a tradition of adopting seventh sons and daughters as godchildren. This tradition dates back to the early 20th century and was initially inspired by a request from Russian immigrants. While an Argentinian werewolf legend called \"el lobison\" exists, claiming seventh sons turn into werewolves, the presidential adoption is not directly linked to counteracting this legend. The practice was intended to honor a custom from Czarist Russia and to prevent the abandonment or murder of seventh children, which was a societal issue in the 19th century. Recently, a Jewish boy became the first non-Catholic to be adopted under this tradition, highlighting its evolution over time.", "342": "Argentina's president adopted a Jewish boy as her godson, marking the first time the tradition included a non-Catholic child. This practice stems from an old Argentinian legend about the \"lobison,\" a werewolf-like creature that supposedly transforms from the seventh son in a family. Fear of this creature led to families abandoning or even murdering their seventh sons in the 19th century. To combat this, the Argentinian president began adopting seventh sons in 1907, later extending the tradition to daughters in 1973.  These adopted children receive a gold medal, educational scholarship, and the president as their official godparent. While the werewolf legend is considered folklore, the tradition continues, offering protection and opportunity to seventh children.", "39": "A loud boom and a 40-foot crater near Managua's international airport sparked claims of a rare meteorite impact. While some officials and witnesses initially attributed the event to a meteorite fragment from a passing asteroid, doubts have emerged. The lack of eyewitness accounts of a fireball, a typical precursor to a meteorite impact, raises skepticism. Experts point out that such a crater would require a significant blast equivalent to a ton of TNT, which should have produced a visible fireball. The timing of the event also clashes with the close approach of asteroid 2014 RC, suggesting they are unrelated.  Nicaragua has requested international assistance to investigate the cause of the blast.", "58": "A loud boom near Managua's airport created a 40-foot crater, leading some to believe a meteorite was responsible.  Government officials and some scientists support this claim, citing eyewitness accounts of a blast and the crater's characteristics. They suggest the meteorite may have broken off from a nearby asteroid. However, NASA scientists express skepticism, pointing out the lack of eyewitness reports of a bright fireball, which they say would be expected with such an impact. They also note the crater's size would require a significant explosion, raising doubts about a meteorite being the cause.  Further investigation, including analysis of the crater and potential meteorite fragments, is needed to determine the true cause of the event.", "28": "Microsoft is testing the use of robotic security guards on its Silicon Valley campus. These robots, called K5s, are equipped with cameras, sensors, and artificial intelligence to monitor their surroundings, detect suspicious activity, and alert human security personnel. They can analyze license plates, recognize faces, and even predict potential crime hotspots. While the robots are not armed, they are designed to deter crime and enhance security. However, there have been some initial challenges, such as the robots struggling to navigate stairs. Despite these hurdles, the pilot program suggests that Microsoft is exploring the use of robots as a supplement to traditional security measures.", "132": "There are conflicting reports about whether robot security guards are patrolling a Microsoft campus in Silicon Valley. Some reports state that Microsoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to deploy a fleet of K5 robots from Knightscope to patrol its campus. These robots are equipped with cameras, sensors, and artificial intelligence to detect suspicious activity and alert human security personnel. They can also read license plates and faces. However, Knightscope's co-founder has denied these reports, stating that while the robots were showcased at an event hosted by Microsoft, they are not currently deployed at the company's campus.", "306": "Argentina's president adopts seventh sons and daughters as godchildren, a tradition dating back to 1907. This practice was initially intended to protect seventh children from the fear and stigma associated with a local legend about them becoming werewolves called \"lobison.\" However, historians clarify that the presidential adoption tradition and the werewolf myth are unrelated. While the werewolf legend led to tragic cases of infanticide in the 19th century, the adoption practice was established as a separate tradition, later extended to girls in 1973 and to Jewish children in 2009. The president's adoption of Yair Tawil, the first Jewish godson, is a continuation of this tradition, not an attempt to prevent him from becoming a werewolf."}
