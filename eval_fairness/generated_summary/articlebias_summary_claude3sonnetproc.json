While Comey portrayed Trump as dishonest, the testimony did not provide a clear legal case for obstruction of justice.

A few Republicans like Jeff Flake openly supported Moore's Democratic opponent Doug Jones instead.

The tapes capture Kelly saying she was let go over integrity issues, and Trump appearing unaware of her firing. Manigault Newman has written a memoir accusing Trump of being racist and mentally unstable.

However, his uncompromising tactics, like pushing the 2013 government shutdown, have alienated Republican colleagues. The Wall Street Journal editorial board expressed skepticism about Cruz's ability to build a winning coalition, arguing his hardline immigration stance will hurt with Hispanic voters.

In a surprising twist, Republican Rand Paul switched his vote supporting Pompeo after assurances from President Trump on winding down wars. Democrat Chris Coons voted \"present\" to aid an absent Republican senator, allowing a favorable recommendation. While Democrats criticized Pompeo's stances on issues like same-sex marriage and climate change, his confirmation now seems likely with support from some Democrats in Trump-won states.

The contract's terms prohibit auditing of Whitefish's labor costs and profits. This no-bid contract to the tiny firm from Interior Secretary Zinke's hometown raised scrutiny from Congress and calls for investigations into the contracting process. Puerto Rico's governor requested an audit, while PREPA defended choosing Whitefish as available to start work quickly, despite the utility having aid agreements with larger companies. Critics questioned why the inexperienced firm was selected over more established utilities.", "politics_508": "The release of Michael Wolff's new book \"Fire and Fury\" has caused an explosive rift between President Trump and his former chief strategist Steve Bannon. The book portrays a chaotic White House and includes controversial quotes from Bannon harshly criticizing Trump's family. Trump has furiously attacked Bannon, saying he \"lost his mind\" and major financial backer Rebekah Mercer has cut ties with him. Some Trump-allied candidates have also distanced themselves from Bannon. Wolff stands by his reporting despite Trump's claims of lies and misrepresentations. The book's publication has been accelerated amid legal threats, only fueling more interest and sales. The fallout highlights the fractured relationship between Trump and the populist faction once led by Bannon.", "elections_560": "As Hurricane Sandy barrels towards the East Coast, the presidential campaigns are being forced to make last-minute adjustments in this critical final week before Election Day. The storm threatens to upend carefully planned schedules, advertising blitzes and get-out-the-vote efforts across several swing states. It provides an opportunity for President Obama to demonstrate leadership in a crisis, but also risks if the federal response falters. For Mitt Romney, the storm limits his ability to make a final push and get his closing message out. The impact on early voting turnout, especially among Obama's key demographic groups like women and minorities, could be significant depending on the storm's severity. With the race extremely tight, the unpredictable hurricane has injected an air of volatility into the campaigns' final stretch.", "world_23": "At Nelson Mandela's memorial service, President Obama's handshake with Cuban President Raul Castro sparked controversy, with Cuban-American lawmakers criticizing it as a propaganda victory for the communist regime. Obama's selfie with the Danish and British prime ministers also drew criticism as inappropriate behavior at a solemn event. However, Obama's powerful speech honoring Mandela's struggle for democracy, freedom, and human rights put dictators in attendance in an uncomfortable position. The president urged continuing Mandela's mission against injustice and inequality, challenging oppressive regimes. The memorial highlighted the clash between Mandela's democratic ideals and the authoritarianism of some leaders present.", "cia_787": "John Brennan, President Obama's nominee for CIA director, faced intense questioning from senators during his confirmation hearing. Senators from both parties raised concerns about the administration's drone strike policies, interrogation techniques, information leaks, and lack of transparency. Brennan defended the legality of targeted killings against al-Qaeda threats but acknowledged issues with past interrogation methods.

Senator Kamala Harris also came under attack, with candidates scrutinizing her \"Medicare for All\" plan and record as California's attorney general.

Democrats are pushing for Bolton and other witnesses, needing support from four Republicans.

In a letter to lawmakers, Barr stated that Mueller did not find evidence that Trump's campaign conspired with Russia, but did not make a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice.

Trump touted the high Republican turnout as growing enthusiasm, while Clinton aimed to make \"America whole\" again.

However, the impasse remains as Democrats warn they may force another shutdown if a deal protecting Dreamers is not reached.

Heller, who is up for re-election in 2018, cited the projected coverage losses and cuts to Medicaid expansion. Insurers like Anthem also announced plans to pull out of Obamacare markets, adding pressure for a replacement.

Protesters reacted by saying the withdrawal comes too late after excessive police force and that they will continue pushing for all their demands to be met.

Hyde-Smith, who is the first woman elected senator from Mississippi, fended off Espy's stronger-than-expected challenge after her remarks brought the race into the national spotlight.

While Clinton still leads nationally, Sanders' momentum and the lack of enthusiasm among many Democrats, particularly millennials, pose a profound challenge. The role of superdelegates, who can support either candidate regardless of primary results, adds an undemocratic wrinkle.

Russia warned of \"extremely serious\" consequences and cut off a military hotline with the U.S. intended to prevent mid-air incidents in Syria's airspace. However, the Trump administration defended the strikes, with U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley stating the U.S. is \"prepared to do more\" to prevent further chemical attacks.

The move isolates the U.S. as only Nicaragua and Syria are non-participants. World leaders like Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and others sharply criticized the move, seeing it as an abandonment of U.S. global leadership.

Smollett was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report about the allegedly staged incident.

However, broader sectoral sanctions on Russia's economy have been held in reserve for now.

Romney'sAddress aimed to connect with undecided voters, though it was overshadowed at times by an unusual interlude featuring Clint Eastwood conversing with an empty chair representing Obama.

Critics question the legal justification and worry about potential mission creep.", "elections_598": "Mitt Romney delivered a major foreign policy speech criticizing President Obama's approach as one of \"passivity\" and not backing words with deeds. Romney vowed a tougher stance, recommitting to a two-state Israeli-Palestinian solution, putting conditions on aid to Egypt, arming Syrian rebels against Assad, and preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. He accused Obama of misunderstanding radical Islam and said the Benghazi attack was likely the work of terrorists imposing their \"dark ideology.\" Romney portrayed substantive differences with Obama's policies in the Middle East as one of \"hope\" not being a strategy. However, critics argued Romney lacked specifics beyond rhetoric and questioned how he would truly operate differently.", "trade_46": "The trade war between the United States and China has escalated, with both countries imposing retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imports. Despite President Trump downplaying the situation as a \"little squabble,\" global markets have tumbled, reflecting investor concerns about a potential full-blown trade war. China has announced new tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, prompting fears of further retaliation from the U.S. The ongoing dispute has rattled markets worldwide, with sharp selloffs in stocks, currencies, and commodities. While Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a deal with China, the conflict appears to be intensifying, raising concerns about its impact on the global economy.", "world_347": "Nelson Mandela, the iconic leader of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, passed away at age 95. He spent 27 years in prison before becoming the country's first black president in 1994, helping dismantle the racist apartheid system. His unwavering pursuit of justice and human rights made him a global symbol of moral courage. His life story inspired figures like Barack Obama and sparked activism against apartheid in the U.S., including protests, boycotts, and popular music promoting his cause. While some tried to rewrite history by claiming solidarity with Mandela, the reality is the U.S. government initially opposed and denounced him before embracing his leadership. Mandela's long journey of personal transformation through prison shaped his philosophy of leading through persuasion over confrontation.", "immigration_328": "President Obama announced a policy to stop deporting certain young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. This allows them to apply for work permits and avoid deportation for two years. Republicans criticized Obama for bypassing Congress and accused him of taking the action for political gain ahead of the election. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, refused to say if he would overturn the policy if elected. He called it a temporary fix and said he would pursue a long-term legislative solution. However, Romney did not provide specifics, likely trying to avoid alienating Hispanic voters who are a crucial bloc. The move showcased the political tensions around immigration reform during an election year.", "elections_410": "The Florida secretary of state ordered recounts in the close U.S. Senate and governor races, reviving memories of the 2000 presidential recount drama. Legal battles and allegations of voter fraud erupted as the Republican leads narrowed after further counting in Democratic strongholds like Broward County. However, analysts suggest the Republican candidates likely still have insurmountable leads barring catastrophic errors. In Georgia's gubernatorial race, Stacey Abrams vowed to pursue litigation despite Republican Brian Kemp declaring victory.

These unresolved high-profile races portend potential weeks of uncertainty and legal challenges.", "elections_778": "The Democratic primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders became increasingly contentious in April 2016 ahead of the New York primary. Sanders claimed Clinton was not qualified to be president, citing her Wall Street ties, Iraq War vote, and trade policies. Clinton's camp fired back, accusing Sanders of crossing a line and demanding he retract the remarks. Former President Bill Clinton also got involved, defending Hillary's 1990s \"super predator\" comments about gang members amid Black Lives Matter protests.

However, experts say the limited assistance of small arms and ammunition is unlikely to tip the balance significantly, as rebels are losing ground. Russia warned that imposing a no-fly zone would violate international law. Former President Clinton praised the decision to support rebels more vigorously.

Romney initially agreed it was a penalty but later said he accepts the Court ruling it is a tax, allowing him to attack Obama for raising taxes. However, Obama rejects calling it a tax. Meanwhile, some conservatives worry Romney's campaign is struggling and not effectively responding to attacks, squandering an opportunity against a weakened incumbent.

In response, the U.S. plans to directly provide military support to Syrian rebels by sending small arms, ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons via the CIA. However, details remain vague and the scope of assistance is unclear. The move increases pressure on Syria's allies like Russia amid calls from some U.S. lawmakers for more aggressive intervention like missile strikes or a no-fly zone.

Romney faced challenges in this effort, being booed at the NAACP convention for proposing to repeal Obamacare. Democrats attacked Romney over his wealth and overseas financial holdings. Obama highlighted Romney's affluence to portray him as out-of-touch with average Americans.

The House Judiciary Committee held hearings laying out the evidence before voting to send the articles to the full House, which impeached Trump, making him only the third president to be impeached in U.S. history.

Potential proposals discussed included universal background checks, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and executive actions by President Obama.

As both conventions approach, the race remains closely contested amidst deep partisan divisions nationwide.", "elections_192": "Recent polls show Donald Trump surging and even leading Hillary Clinton in some battleground states like Nevada, Ohio and Florida. However, Clinton's campaign has been disrupted after she fell ill at a 9/11 memorial and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia. This reignited concerns about her health and trustworthiness given her initial lack of transparency. Both campaigns have committed to releasing more medical records.

Comey accused Trump of defaming him and the FBI, alleging that Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn's Russia contacts. Comey's contemporaneous memos detailed conversations where Trump requested his loyalty and urged him to let the Flynn probe go. Trump dismissed Comey, initially citing his handling of the Clinton email case before admitting the Russia investigation was a factor. This prompted accusations of obstruction of justice.

Romney faced an uphill battle in the foreign policy arena, which is seen as a strength for Obama. However, Romney aimed to shift focus to the economy, portraying Obama as offering little new. Obama countered by accusing Romney of being vague on policies. Polls showed a tight race, with Obama slightly ahead but Romney's supporters more enthusiastic.

This contradictory statement raised questions about whether Sessions committed perjury. While some experts argued the standard for perjury was likely not met given ambiguities, others claimed he was at least misleading.

The conflict has deepened the lack of empathy and segregation between Israelis and Palestinians, even in mixed communities like Jerusalem.

The DeSantis-Gillum race is seen as a test of the rising polarization in U.S. politics, with both candidates catering to their party's base rather than the middle ground. The controversial \"monkey\" remark highlighted the racially-charged rhetoric that often impacts candidates of color.", "elections_165": "Despite Hillary Clinton's significant delegate lead, Bernie Sanders scored victories in the Oregon and Kentucky Democratic primaries, though Clinton narrowly won Kentucky by less than 2,000 votes.

Rosenstein has denied the allegations. His potential departure raised concerns among Democrats about protecting Mueller's investigation, while Republicans like Lindsey Graham accused him of being part of a \"bureaucratic coup\" against Trump.

Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations in emotional testimony. Republicans argued the FBI should not investigate decades-old claims, citing comments from Joe Biden during the Clarence Thomas hearings. Democrats pushed for an FBI probe. Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed after a pitched partisan battle, with questions remaining about the truth of the allegations and whether the process was fair and thorough. The divisive episode underscored America's deep political divisions.", "fbi_395": "Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 16, 2018, just days before he was eligible for retirement benefits. The stated reason was that McCabe had misled investigators reviewing the FBI's probe into Hillary Clinton's emails. However, McCabe claimed he was being targeted by the Trump administration over his involvement in the Russia investigation and his corroboration of James Comey's accounts about President Trump. The firing sparked accusations from former intelligence officials of political interference and retaliation by Trump against those who crossed him. It reignited debates about potential obstruction of justice and attacks on law enforcement by the president.", "healthcare_394": "The launch of the Healthcare.gov website for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was plagued with technical glitches, error messages, and slow loading times, frustrating millions trying to sign up. Despite over 19 million website visits, only around 500,000 applications were started in the first few weeks. President Obama acknowledged the unacceptable problems, vowed to fix them, and encouraged signing up by phone as a workaround. The administration was working to increase staffing and bring in tech experts to address the issues. There were calls for Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to resign over the botched rollout, though Obama voiced confidence in her. The flawed launch was a major embarrassment for the signature healthcare law.", "world_344": "The crisis in eastern Ukraine has escalated with pro-Russian separatists occupying government buildings, despite a Geneva accord aimed at de-escalation. The Ukrainian government accuses Russia of fomenting the unrest, providing photos allegedly showing Russian intelligence operatives involved. Russia denies direct involvement but made contradictory statements. Vice President Biden visited Kiev, warning Russia of further sanctions if it does not act to defuse tensions.

The U.S. and allies are pressuring Russia through diplomacy and potential broader economic sanctions to change course.", "immigration_14": "The Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy of criminally prosecuting all illegal border crossers led to separating thousands of immigrant children from their parents. There was widespread outcry over the psychological trauma this caused children, with some being sent to \"tender age\" shelters.

However, it did not address reuniting already separated families. Immigration advocates said family detention was still unacceptable.

The outcome came as a relief to British Prime Minister David Cameron and allies like the US who wanted to preserve the UK's global influence. The vote narrowly avoided potential economic turmoil and complications like Scotland leaving NATO and the division of UK debt and assets. However, with 45% voting for independence, the issue remains divisive. First Minister Alex Salmond resigned but vowed the dream wouldn't die. Cameron promised more powers for Scotland while seeking a \"balanced settlement\" addressing voices in England too.", "israel_714": "President Obama visited Israel for the first time as president, aiming to mend strained relations with Prime Minister Netanyahu and address regional issues like Iran's nuclear program and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Obama pushed for more diplomacy on Iran while backing Israel's right to self-defense. The leaders agreed to negotiate extending U.S. military aid to Israel past 2017. On the Palestinian front, Obama urged peace talks but did not unveil a new peace plan. He also warned Syria it would be held accountable for using chemical weapons.

The Supreme Court ruled that the ban can't apply to foreign nationals with a \"bona fide relationship\" with a person or entity in the U.S. The administration has defined close family ties that qualify, including spouses and children, but excluding grandparents and other extended relatives. Those with job offers or invitations from U.S. universities are also exempt.

Lerner was subsequently placed on administrative leave after refusing to resign. Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel is seeking to clean house, replacing Lerner with a 27-year IRS veteran to lead the division.

They celebrated the defeat of recent background check legislation and vowed to grow their membership to 10 million. Meanwhile, gun control advocates criticized the NRA's stance, with Sen.

The event highlighted the intense cultural divide over gun rights and fueled the ongoing debate between the two sides.", "terrorism_433": "Republicans have intensified their investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack, accusing the Obama administration of a cover-up to protect political interests ahead of the presidential election. Recent congressional hearings featured testimony from whistleblowers claiming the talking points given to UN Ambassador Susan Rice were revised by the State Department to remove references to terrorism. House Republicans are demanding the White House release internal emails showing the talking point revisions. While Democrats dismiss it as partisan politics, Republicans believe the administration misled the public on Benghazi and want to determine what role, if any, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton played.

However, U.S. Attorney John Durham disagreed with some of the report's conclusions regarding the predication and opening of the investigation.

While Republicans are favored to make Senate gains, Democrats are outperforming 2012 presidential results in many red states.

The GOP countered with $800 billion in tax revenue from closing loopholes, $900 billion in entitlement cuts, and switching to chained CPI for Social Security.
