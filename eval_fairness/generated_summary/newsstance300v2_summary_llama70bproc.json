{"173": "The salami technique is a method of embezzlement where a computer criminal rounds down fractions of pennies in interest-bearing accounts and diverts the surplus to a dummy account. This technique is hard to detect as the amounts are small and unlikely to be noticed by depositors. A similar method was used by two programmers who increased by two cents the amount withheld from fellow employees' paychecks for federal taxes and directed the money to their own accounts. Another case involved a bank employee who used the bank's computer to transfer small amounts from 300 checking accounts to a dummy account. The employee was careful not to divert sums from any particular account more than three times a year, making it difficult to detect. These examples support the claim that bank employees can embezzle large amounts of money by stealing small sums from many different accounts.", "143": "The claim that cheap soy sauce is made from the hair of Chinese convicts has been a subject of debate. Some sources suggest that this claim is true, while others refute it. An investigation by Chinese journalists found that a soy sauce manufacturer in Hubei province was using amino acid syrup derived from human hair to produce the condiment. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the hair used in this process came from Chinese convicts. Additionally, the Chinese government has banned the production of soy sauce using human hair. On the other hand, some sources suggest that the claim is entirely false and has no basis in fact. Ultimately, the origin of the hair used in soy sauce production remains unclear, and further investigation is needed to confirm or refute the claim.", "200": "Please provide a summary that is around 100 words, and does not include any information that is not relevant to the claim.

Someone who witnessed the event said that TSA took nail clippers and a multi tool from the soldiers, and that they were screened by TSA agents. However, the National Guard has denied that TSA had access to the facility where the soldiers were processed, and TSA has also denied confiscating nail clippers, saying that they have never been prohibited. There is a rumor that nail clippers are not allowed, but this has been denied by TSA. It appears that there is no evidence to support the claim that TSA confiscated nail clippers from the soldiers.", "179": "The claim that CFL light bulbs are dangerous compared to conventional incandescent bulbs because they emit higher levels of radiation is not entirely supported by the provided documents. One document states that CFLs do indeed put out more EMF in certain frequencies than incandescent or halogen bulbs, but there is no evidence that this level of EMF poses any health consequences. Another document suggests that single envelope CFLs should not be used at distances less than 30 cm to avoid any long-term health effects in the general population. However, it also states that CFLs at a distance of 30 cm, and by extension greater distances, do not pose a significant risk of acute injury to the eyes or skin compared to traditional incandescent lamps. A third document mentions that scientific knowledge in the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation is extensive, and current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields. Therefore, while there is some concern about the levels of radiation emitted by CFLs, the evidence suggests that they are not significantly more dangerous than conventional incandescent bulbs.", "187": "The claim that cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien origin has sparked controversy. Genetic testing of samples from the Paracas skulls revealed mutations that were unknown to any man, primate, or animal found on Earth, suggesting a completely new human-like being. However, some experts argue that the DNA identified as human, but with abnormalities that could be caused by contamination or defects in the process, requiring further study. The practice of skull shaping may have been a tradition among ancient cultures for various reasons, such as beauty, group cohesion, or signaling trust and connection. Archaeologists believe that the skulls belonged to humans who lived 2,000 years ago and that the shape can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe. While there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim of alien origin, the genetic testing results and unusual skull shape raise questions and fuel the mystery surrounding these anomalous skulls.", "193": "The claim that Bill Clinton fathered an illegitimate, mixed-race son named Danney Williams with an Arkansas prostitute in 1985 has been thoroughly debunked by various sources. Firstly, a DNA comparison conducted by the FBI and reported in the Starr Report ruled out paternity. The test showed that Clinton was not the father of Danney Williams, not even close. Secondly, Bobbie Ann Williams, Danney's mother, who was a former prostitute, admitted that she fabricated the story of her relationship with Clinton and the subsequent pregnancy. Lastly, a second genetic fingerprinting test performed on the president's DNA yielded a paternity index of only 20 to 30, which is not conclusive and falls short of the legal threshold of 100. Therefore, the claim that Bill Clinton fathered Danney Williams is baseless and unsubstantiated.", "208": "The remains of more than 250 soldiers were dumped in a landfill between 2004 and 2008, a fact that was ignored by the mainstream media. According to Air Force officials, the Dover Air Force Base mortuary disposed of portions of troops' remains by cremating them and dumping the ashes in a Virginia landfill from 2003 to 2008. This practice was not disclosed to relatives of fallen service members, and the military contractor responsible for the disposal likened the procedure to the disposal of medical waste. Although the Air Force claimed that the practice was discontinued in 2008 because \"there was a better way to do it,\" it is clear that the media blackout on the return of fallen troops from the Middle East contributed to the lack of public awareness about this issue.", "146": "On the other hand, some studies have proposed evolutionary arguments for why females would synchronize the timing of sexual receptivity, assuming that synchrony would serve to maximize the reproductive success of females and also sometimes males.

In conclusion, the scientific evidence does not support the claim that women's menstrual cycles synchronize when they live or work in close proximity to one another.", "149": "In the 1950s, black entertainer Dorothy Dandridge was not allowed to stay in hotels where she performed. In one instance, a hotel drained its pool after she dipped her toe in the water. This was not an isolated incident, as other African American entertainers faced similar discrimination. No African American was allowed to use a hotel room, restaurant, casino, showroom, or pool in Las Vegas. When Dandridge deliberately dipped her foot in the pool, the hotel drained it, showing the depth of racism she faced. The incident was so powerful that it was included in a film about her life, highlighting the reality of racism in the 1950s.", "219": "The claim that certain areas in the United States, France, and Britain are considered Muslim \"no-go zones\" where local laws are not applicable is a controversial topic. Some experts argue that these areas are not full-fledged no-go zones but rather \"sensitive urban zones\" that can erupt in unpredictable ways, such as car burnings and attacks on representatives of the state. Others have apologized for making regrettable errors on air regarding the Muslim population in Europe, stating that there is no credible information to support the assertion that specific areas exclude individuals based solely on their religion. However, some argue that these no-go zones exist throughout Europe, describing them as amorphous, non-contiguous areas where Shariah courts have been set up, and the police don't go in, creating separate countries within a country. Ultimately, the extent to which these areas can be considered no-go zones under Sharia Law is a matter of interpretation and debate.", "142": "The claim that Kellogg's is adding traces of peanut flour to its products has been supported and opposed by different documents. On one hand, a document states that Kellogg's has discontinued a product that contained trace amounts of peanut flour, suggesting that the company may have indeed added it to avoid complying with stricter regulations regarding allergens. Another document suggests that Kellogg's is intentionally adding traces of peanut flour to other products beyond their Keebler and Austin Cracker lines. However, a statement from Kellogg's denies this claim, stating that they do not add peanut flour to their products to avoid complying with the Food Safety Modernization Act and that they follow strict food safety standards that include allergen control as part of their hazard analyses. It is unclear whether Kellogg's is indeed adding traces of peanut flour to its products, but it is evident that there is speculation and concern about the company's practices regarding allergens.", "175": "A man whose car bore personalized license plates reading 'NO PLATE' received notices for thousands of unpaid parking tickets.

He said city officials told him the tickets were issued by mistake because of his vanity plate   XXXXXXX.

However, this claim is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the NRA has asked attendees not to bring their firearms to certain events, such as the concert held at the Bridgestone Arena, this is due to pre-existing laws and insurance requirements. In fact, attendees with proper licenses are allowed to carry firearms in the Music City Center, following all federal, state, and local laws. Additionally, vendors at the convention are simply following federal and state laws on the purchase and possession of firearms.

In fact, the tribunal's own website states that its rulings are nonbinding and must be conducted in accordance with local, state, and federal laws within the United States. Furthermore, experts have noted that religious mediation services like the Islamic tribunal exist throughout the US for Christians, Jews, and other devout worshipers as a way to avoid heading to a civil court, and are not unique to Islam. Therefore, while an Islamic tribunal may exist in Dallas, it does not appear to have any legal authority or be a violation of the establishment clause of the US Constitution.", "151": "There is evidence that induced abortion is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Research has shown that having an abortion increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, regardless of her parity or the timing of the abortion relative to her first pregnancy. However, some studies have found no association between abortion and breast cancer risk, suggesting that the relationship between the two is not straightforward. Furthermore, some research has suggested that reporting bias may be a problem in case-control studies of induced abortion and breast cancer risk, as women may underreport their history of abortion. Overall, while some studies support a link between abortion and breast cancer, the evidence is not conclusive, and further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the two.", "164": "Starbucks has joined Monsanto in a lawsuit against Vermont to avoid the implementation of GMO labeling regulations.

The petition claiming that Starbucks is part of this litigation is completely false.", "163": "A Michigan farmer recently posted on Facebook about having to destroy 14% of his tart cherry crop, which is around 40,000 edible cherries, to make way for cherries imported from outside the U.S. He claims that he is not allowed to donate or use the diverted cherries in any way, which has sparked controversy and debate. However, according to a horticulture specialist, Kevin Robson, the claim is misleading and based on a shallow understanding of the federal marketing order. The order, administered by the Cherry Industry Administrative Board, aims to stabilize both prices and supply of cherries, which has been notoriously volatile in the past. The farmer has options to sell the surplus cherries in overseas markets or domestically in a newly created market, or work with the Cherry Industry Administrative board to find a place to donate the surplus cherries. Therefore, the claim that a Michigan farmer was forced to destroy 40,000 edible cherries to make way for cherries imported from outside the U.S. is not entirely accurate.", "205": "A carbon monoxide spike on the west coast has sparked fears of an impending earthquake, but the scientific community is divided on the matter. Some researchers suggest that the gas could be used as a precursor signal for an earthquake early warning system, citing a study that found a burst of carbon monoxide was released a few days before an earthquake. However, others argue that the current pollution pattern is not connected to the San Andreas fault and that there is no reliable indicator for predicting earthquakes. In fact, one scientist has warned that some websites are creating misleading stories and causing anxiety among readers. It's important to note that elevated carbon monoxide concentrations over California have been deemed incorrect due to unrealistic emissions from satellite observations of fires. While there is some evidence to suggest that carbon monoxide could be a useful tool in predicting earthquakes, the scientific consensus seems to be that there is no reliable way to predict such events.", "213": "The family of Anne Frank sought refugee status in the United States and Cuba during the Nazi occupation of Holland in 1941. Otto Frank, Anne's father, corresponded with a friend, Nathan Straus Jr., who had connections with the U.S. Housing Authority, and two private Jewish agencies to secure visas. However, their efforts were unsuccessful due to strict State Department restrictions against refugees and a new policy that prohibited refugees with close relatives in Europe. Despite obtaining affidavits from employers and relatives in Massachusetts, the family's application was denied. Cuba issued a visa to Otto Frank, but it was canceled when Germany declared war on the United States. The documents reveal the desperate efforts of the Frank family to escape the Nazi regime and the challenges they faced in seeking refuge in the United States.", "155": "The medical establishment has faced a paradox: the need for both a living body and a dead donor for organ transplant.

The lawsuit also alleges that the school district has taken other discriminatory actions against transgender students, such as denying them access to boys' restrooms and requiring them to use girls' restrooms or a single-occupancy restroom. However, the school district has denied the allegations, stating that they do not have a practice or policy requiring any student to wear a wristband for monitoring purposes.", "201": "According to some medical professionals, there is a growing trend of \"sex roulette\" parties where one participant is HIV-positive and the others are not, with the intention of giving the experience a thrill. The parties are reportedly attended by gay men and involve group sex with no condoms. The claim is supported by a doctor at Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, who states that people have lost respect for HIV and now view it as a manageable chronic illness rather than a deadly disease. However, there is limited evidence to back up these reports, and some argue that the logistics of organizing such parties would be difficult and that the identity of the HIV-positive guest would not be a secret.

In his speech, Obama reported to the American people that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden. He acknowledged the team of Americans who carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. He also thanked the intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. However, a source claims that President Obama attempted to stop or delay Osama Bin Laden's demise and did not leave the golf course for the situation room until 20 minutes before SEAL Team 6 took him out. President Obama privately thanked the Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden and recognized the full assault force with the Presidential Unit Citation, the highest honor that can be given to a unit.", "150": "Peanut oil has been used as an adjuvant in vaccines since the 1960s, but it's not always listed as an ingredient because only trace amounts remain in the final product.

Some vaccine manufacturers use peanut oil as a trade secret ingredient to enhance the strength of their vaccines, but they don't list it to avoid alerting competitors. Despite concerns about its safety, peanut oil has been shown to be safe and potent in human trials, although its use has been discontinued due to reactogenicity. Alternative adjuvants have been developed, but there is still no oil emulsion adjuvant that can be used in humans. The evidence supports the claim that peanut oil is present in childhood vaccines and flu shots, although the amount is considered safe and its use is not always disclosed.", "202": "The state of Mississippi has passed a bill that allows churchgoers to shoot and kill citizens at will. The bill, known as the \"Mississippi Church Protection Act,\" grants churches the power to designate members as \"security\" who can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death. The bill also expands a previous law that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel, or briefcase and allows open carry in public. The bill effectively recognizes churches as their own sovereign entities that are tax-free and immune from their acts of violence carried out in their official duties. The bill also provides criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security.

Most bases have decided to make the change to morning chow since this meal had the lowest attendance throughout the day. However, there is no truth to the Internet myth that Washington budget cuts have taken away breakfast for service members in Afghanistan. Service members at closing bases receive packaged meals known as \"meals, ready to eat,'' or MREs instead of a hot, prepared breakfast. All soldiers are receiving 4 meals per day.

The anticipated film features three scenes leading up to Jobs's introduction of key product unveilings: the original Mac, NeXT, and the iPod. Seth Rogen is in final talks to play the role of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Therefore, there is a need to find a new actor to play Steve Jobs. The role requires an actor who can handle a demanding part, as it involves a lot of work on set and a lot of words to say in the movie. The actor should also be able to portray Jobs's character effectively, as the film focuses on three pivotal keynote presentations given by Steve Jobs.

Another source reports that Bale has decided not to play the role, citing the actor's decision that he is not right for the part. A third source states that Christian Bale will play Steve Jobs in the upcoming movie, based on Aaron Sorkin's screenplay. Sorkin has confirmed that Bale will play the role, describing him as the best actor for the part. However, a fourth source reports that Bale will not play Jobs, and the studio is now looking for a replacement.

However, the claim is refuted by the information that Bale has decided to exit the project, citing that he didn't feel he was the right person to play the iconic figure on film. The film's screenplay, written by Aaron Sorkin, is said to focus on three pivotal keynote presentations given by Steve Jobs, and actor Seth Rogen is also in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

However, this claim was later debunked by Shirley Powell, the Weather Channel's spokesperson. According to Powell, Seidel was not relieving himself, but was instead using his cell phone as an IFB (interruptible feedback) to get his cues from the control room. Seidel lost his phone signal and was frantically dialing his phone when the anchor tossed to him, causing him to appear as if he was relieving himself. Brian Williams, the NBC News anchor, also cleared the record on behalf of Seidel, stating that social media owes Seidel an apology for the wild misinformation. In reality, Seidel was hunched over dialing NBC, not relieving himself.", "112": "A video was created by Everlast, a Peruvian TV show, and an activist group called Paremos el Acoso Callejero to demonstrate how some men disrespect women by catcalling them on the streets. The video titled \"Harassing Your Mother\" shows two mothers dressing up and walking in front of their sons, who are repeat offenders of catcalling, without their sons recognizing them. The sons catcall their mothers, and the mothers respond angrily, revealing their identity. The video ends with the message that if men cannot respect women, they should not wait for someone to harass their own mother to start respecting them. This video highlights the issue of sexual harassment and the need for men to respect women, and it supports the claim that catcalling is never funny unless it is these bros tricked into catcalling their mothers.", "223": "There is a debate surrounding Neil Armstrong's famous phrase \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" which he said as he became the first person to set foot on the moon.

Some journalists who were present at the event also support this version. However, others argue that there is no evidence that Armstrong actually said \"a man,\" and that the transmission was clear and accurate. Ultimately, the question of whether Armstrong flubbed his line or not remains a matter of interpretation and personal belief.", "156": "The claim that Jesus and His disciples are going to be portrayed as homosexual in a soon-to-be-released film has been circulating through a chain letter.

Tridevil claims to have contacted over 50 doctors before finding one willing to perform the surgery and has documented her post-surgery life through social media. However, some have questioned the authenticity of her story, including a top plastic surgeon who claims no reasonable doctor would perform the operation.

The fifth-grade teaching team had concerns about committing 20 hours of instructional time to something that is not part of the fifth-grade curriculum. The Anti-Defamation League investigated and found that a Jewish family, who was wrongfully blamed for the cancellation, actually left on a previously planned vacation for the holidays. The school district also released a statement clarifying that the play was canceled due to the inordinate amount of class time taken up by rehearsals, and not because of any request from parents. However, some parents have come forward claiming that their child was harassed by classmates since the school announced the cancellation.

This evidence supports the claim that the photo is authentic and that Sanders was involved in the civil rights movement. In contrast, a statement by Rep.

CNN's source maintains that Rivers stopped breathing after Korovin attempted a second laryngoscopy following an endoscopy.

According to a Japanese news article, a teacher reported that an eyeball-licking trend among his students resulted in a pink eye outbreak. The practice is believed to have started after a music video featuring the act was released. Medical professionals warn that eyeball licking can spread bacterial infections and other diseases. However, some Japanese professional organizations and ophthalmological associations were unaware of any such outbreak. The editor of the news article that first reported the story admitted that it was meant to titillate rather than inform.

The video has also been described as a social experiment that shows how people can be quick to judge others based on their appearance.

Thomas posted on Facebook about his experience and included photos of the scar. He said that he had not felt so violated before and was glad it was all over.

One researcher, who was part of the team that produced the datasets used in the study, has stated unequivocally that the research is not only wrong, but also irresponsible social science that should never have been published.

In contrast, Canadian seniors receive a monthly pension from the Old Age Security (OAS) program, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). The average monthly benefits for Canadian seniors are higher than the temporary monthly allowance for refugees. It is incorrect to assume that refugees receive more financial assistance from the federal government than Canadian pensioners.", "21": "The claim is about a woman named Lucita Sandoval, who is allegedly a teacher, and has been accused of being a sexual predator after her private sex tape was used for a hoax. The story about her affair with a 16-year-old student went viral after a video allegedly showing the two having sex leaked. However, the video in question is from a porn website and features a woman and a college student, not a teacher and her pupil. The story rapidly spread throughout Latin America and picked up even more steam when English wire services reported it. The real woman who appears in the clip is from a different Argentine city, Corrientes, and she does have a teaching degree, but was not employed at the school in question. Therefore, the claim that Lucita Sandoval is wrongly being called a sexual predator after her private sex tape was used for a hoax is supported.", "249": "The claim that Dylan Thomas's stomach had a burrowing spider is being questioned by experts. According to Christopher Buddle, a McGill University associate professor, the story is \"extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible\". Buddle thinks a spider wouldn't crawl beneath skin through a scar, and the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and the biology of spiders. Charles Griswold, a California Academy of Sciences curator, agrees that it is impossible for a spider to do this, and if there was an organism associated with this, it would likely be a tick or mite.

However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have consistently denied these rumors, stating that the vaccines do not contain any contraceptive vaccines or substances that interfere with fertility or pregnancy. In fact, the vaccines have been tested in laboratories and were found to contain only tetanus toxoid, and not hCG, a hormone that some claim is linked to sterilization. Additionally, the vaccination campaigns are aimed at eliminating neonatal tetanus in Kenya, which disproportionately affects newborns and mothers in areas with limited access to healthcare. The campaigns target women of childbearing age because they are most at risk of contracting tetanus during childbirth, and vaccinating them provides protection to both the mother and the unborn child. The vaccine requires multiple doses to provide long-term protection, and it has been used safely for many years to protect people against tetanus. Overall, the evidence suggests that the tetanus vaccine campaigns in Kenya are a legitimate public health effort and not a ruse for sterilization.", "145": "The claim that animals are fleeing Yellowstone Park as a sign of an imminent supervolcano eruption is supported by reports of bison, elk, and other animals migrating out of the park, and witness accounts of animals running for no apparent reason. However, experts argue that this migration is a natural response to the changing seasons and the search for food, and that there is no evidence to suggest an eruption is imminent. Seismologists have emphasized that recent earthquakes in the area do not signal an impending eruption, and research suggests that the Yellowstone supervolcano is on a \"dying cycle\" rather than a \"ramping up cycle\".

The adoption is part of a tradition that dates back to 1907 and has been extended to baby girls in 1973. The President has described the adoption as a \"magical moment\" and called the boy's family a \"marvelous family.\" The adoption also comes with a gold medal and a full educational scholarship. While some may view the legend as ridiculous, it has been a long-standing tradition in Argentina and has been linked to cases of child abandonment and murder in the past.

The actor reportedly had much deliberation and conflicting feelings before concluding that he was not right for the part. The film's screenplay, written by Aaron Sorkin, focuses on three pivotal keynote presentations given by Steve Jobs, and Seth Rogen is in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. However, Bale's departure could come at a bad time for the project, which was scheduled to begin filming later this winter. It is worth noting that while some sources confirm Bale's involvement in the project, others suggest that he has dropped out. The reason for his withdrawal is unclear, but it may be due to conflicting feelings or a lack of confidence in his ability to portray Jobs effectively.", "51": "A Catholic priest, Father John Micheal O'Neal, from Massachusetts, was clinically dead for 48 minutes before being revived by doctors.

They cited the lack of eyewitness accounts of a flash of light in the sky that would be expected to accompany such a meteor strike. Additionally, no blackened fragments of the impacting body were found in or around the crater, which is inconsistent with a meteorite impact.

State officials have allowed oil and gas companies to pump nearly three billion gallons of wastewater into underground aquifers that could have been used for drinking water or irrigation, and some of this wastewater has been re-injected into aquifers closer to the surface. The Cawelo Water District uses treated oilfield produced water for irrigation, which has raised concerns about the safety of the water and the potential impact on the fruit grown with it. While some studies have shown that the water is safe and the fruit is not impacted, other tests have found toxic chemicals in the water and experts have raised concerns about the long-term health impacts.

However, other sources claim that the news of KFC marijuana sales is a hoax and that the company has not made any such announcement. Some argue that it is unlikely for KFC to start selling marijuana as it is still a federally illegal drug and the company would face legal and financial issues.

Despite this, Islam has shown remarkable financial acumen and has been profiled by Business Insider and New York Magazine. He plans to start a hedge fund with his friends, and his inspiration is Paul Tudor Jones.

The tradition was originally established to counteract a legend that the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf. The meeting between Kirchner and Tawil's family coincided with Hanukkah, and she described it as a \"magical moment.\" However, some sources indicate that the story of the adoption being related to the werewolf legend is a nice mixture of folklore and truth that fooled plenty of people, and that the honor of being a presidential godson has nothing to do with keeping a werewolf at bay.", "31": "A 21-year-old Australian man, Dylan Thomas, was on a trip to Bali when he discovered a strange red trail stretching up his stomach.

Doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin and extracted it from his abdomen. The spider had burrowed through a small scar left by a previous operation to remove his appendix. Some experts have expressed skepticism about the story, suggesting that it is unlikely a spider would crawl beneath skin through a scar and that the evidence presented is not convincing.", "57": "A New York City high school student, Mohammed Islam, was profiled in New York Magazine for his stock trading skills, which claimed that he made $72 million.

The legend was so widespread that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true, and the presidential adoption tradition was started to stop the deadly stigma. The adoption tradition was extended to seventh daughters in 1973. Tawil's parents wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor, citing the 2009 decree that allows children from other religions to qualify. The president described the meeting with Tawil's family as a \"magical moment\" and described Yair as a \"total sweety.\" However, some reports that the president adopted Tawil specifically to keep him from becoming a werewolf may have been exaggerated, as the two customs are not related, according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda.", "362": "A crater was discovered near Managua's international airport, and initial reports suggested that it was caused by a meteorite.

The asteroid 2014 RC, which passed close to Earth on Sunday, was thought to be a possible source of the meteorite, but experts have ruled out this possibility. The Nicaraguan government has appealed for witnesses to come forward, and the country's Institute of Territorial Studies is working with the US Geological Survey to investigate the incident.

Suspicions were raised when a stolen luggage report from the Tampa International Airport listed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" among the items, and the fact that Tridevil's real name and cell phone number were easily found. Additionally, a top plastic surgeon expressed skepticism that a reasonable doctor would perform such a surgery, and Tridevil's own words, \"I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men.

However, astronomers, including experts at NASA, have questioned whether the blast and crater were actually the product of a meteorite. They say the lack of eyewitness accounts and the timeline raise doubts about that scenario. NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans said, \"There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.\" Nicaraguan officials are now confused and have asked the U.S. to help sort the whole thing out.", "7": "An Australian man, Dylan Thomas, was on holiday in Bali when he discovered a tropical spider had burrowed underneath his skin through his appendix scar.

He went to see a dermatologist, and doctors managed to extract the spider from his abdomen. The spider had burrowed just below the surface of his skin and was found to be a match-head-sized tropical spider. Thomas posted photos of the scar on his Facebook page, joking about developing superpowers. The incident happened while Thomas was holidaying on the Indonesian island, and he was diagnosed with a tropical spider that had been living inside of him for three days.
