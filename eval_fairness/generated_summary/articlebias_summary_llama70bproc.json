Trump has criticized the leak of the questions, calling it \"disgraceful\" and suggesting that it was done to create a \"witch hunt\" atmosphere. Some experts believe that the leak may have come from Trump's legal team, as it allows them to portray the investigation as biased. The questions cover a range of topics, including potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and possible attempts to obstruct justice by the president.", "us_senate_603": "The latest Republican effort to repeal Obamacare has failed, with Senate leaders canceling plans to vote on the bill due to a lack of support from their own party members.

The failure marks the third time this year that Republicans have been unable to fulfill their campaign promise to repeal Obamacare.

The US is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and its withdrawal from the agreement makes it harder for the world to avoid temperatures rising by more than two degrees Celsius by 2100. The decision also damages America's strategic position in the world and its standing in international negotiations on a range of issues.", "elections_416": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been under fire for not releasing more than two years of his personal income tax returns.

Romney has been accused of hiding something in his tax returns that would be damaging to his campaign. Despite this, Romney has refused to release more returns, saying that it would only give the Obama campaign more information to distort and be dishonest about.

The decision is a significant blow to the landmark healthcare law passed under President Barack Obama in 2010 .

Romney has been criticized for his wealth and investments in overseas bank and investment accounts, which have been highlighted by Democrats and President Obama's campaign. Romney's appearance at the NAACP was seen as an attempt to directly address black voters, who are critical to Obama's re-election.

The candidates were forced to own their records and flip-flops, with Megyn Kelly of Fox News hosting the debate and asking tough questions.

Trump later clarified his statement, saying he meant to say he did not see any reason why it \"wouldn't\" be Russia, rather than \"would.\" Trump also said he accepts the US intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the election, but added that others could have been involved as well.

The election also saw high turnout from both parties, with Republicans shattering their party's turnout record and Democrats falling short of their 2008 performance. Analysts believe this result could indicate a high-turnout election in the fall. Clinton's loss has sparked questions about her campaign's authenticity and ability to inspire voters.

Democrats argue that the vote is a waste of time and that the law is becoming more popular two years after its passage.

The budget proposal would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, but it assumes the elimination of the sequester, which would otherwise account for $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. The plan includes \"chained CPI,\" which would over time reduce cost-of-living increases to Social Security and other federal benefit programs, effectively cutting Social Security benefits by tying them to inflation.

The investigation is ongoing, with the FBI working to determine the motive and identity of the person or people responsible for sending the packages.", "elections_739": "Donald Trump has finally acknowledged that President Barack Obama was born in the United States, ending a long-standing conspiracy theory that he had promoted. Trump had previously refused to answer questions about Obama's birthplace, but on Friday, he stated that Obama was born in the US, period. Trump also accused Hillary Clinton of starting the birther controversy, despite no evidence that she did so. Clinton and her allies have reacted to Trump's statement with disgust, calling him a liar. Trump's shift comes as he has emerged as a more disciplined candidate, relatively, after Kellyanne Conway was installed as his campaign manager.", "isis_807": "The U.S. military has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, but the Pentagon admits that intelligence gaps hinder its ability to determine their effectiveness. Despite satellite, drone, and surveillance flights, the U.S. military relies on limited information from human spotters on the ground. Meanwhile, President Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence underestimated the threat posed by ISIS and overestimated the Iraqi army's capacity to defeat the militant group. Senator John McCain criticized the President's decision not to leave a residual U.S. military force in Iraq and his refusal to arm moderate Syrian rebels last year. The White House has eased off blaming the intelligence community, but lawmakers and intelligence officials have faulted the administration for not taking their warnings about ISIS seriously enough.", "elections_645": "Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, announced that he would not participate in the upcoming Fox News debate, citing concerns with one of the debate moderators, Megyn Kelly. Trump has had a history of controversial statements and has been criticized for his treatment of women. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said that the decision was made because Fox News was \"playing games\" with Trump. The debate will go on without Trump, and his absence may affect his standing in the polls. Trump's closest rival, Ted Cruz, accused Trump of being \"afraid\" of Megyn Kelly. Trump has been under fire for his treatment of women, and his decision to skip the debate may be seen as a way to avoid facing tough questions on the issue.", "terrorism_477": "The FBI has released photos and a brief videotape of two men suspected of involvement in the Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three and injured nearly 180. The men, identified as Suspect No. 1 and Suspect No. 2, were seen walking single file on Boylston Street toward the marathon's finish line, carrying black backpacks. One wore a white baseball cap turned backward, and the other wore a black one. The FBI believes that Suspect No. 2 planted the bombs near the finish line and both men are considered armed and dangerous. The public is being asked to help identify the suspects by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI or going to the FBI's website.", "elections_662": "Ted Cruz has announced his candidacy for the US presidency, joining a growing field of Republican hopefuls. Cruz, a Texas senator and Tea Party favorite, has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration and has sought to position himself as a champion of conservative values. In his announcement speech, he emphasized the need for a return to constitutional principles and religious liberty, and called for the repeal of Obamacare and a flat tax. Cruz's campaign launch has been met with skepticism by some, who question his ability to appeal to a broad coalition of voters and his hardline stance on immigration."}
