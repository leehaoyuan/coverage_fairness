{"173": "A method of embezzlement involves stealing small sums from many different accounts, often through computer manipulation. In one instance, a programmer rounded down odd cents in sales commission accounts, channeling the funds into a dummy account. Similarly, an embezzler used a bank's computer to transfer twenty or thirty cents at a time from 300 checking accounts to a dummy account. The \"salami technique\" also involves rounding down fractions of pennies in interest-bearing accounts, diverting the surplus to a dummy account. These methods allow large sums to be embezzled quietly over time, often going unnoticed by banks and depositors.", "143": "There have been claims that cheap soy sauce is made from the hair of Chinese convicts, but no direct evidence supports this specific claim. An investigation found that some manufacturers used amino acid syrups, which can be derived from human hair, to produce soy sauce. A Chinese company, Hongshuai Soy Sauce, was found to use human hair from barber shops, hospitals, and salons to make amino acids for their soy sauce. However, there is no evidence that the hair comes from convicts. The Chinese government has banned the use of hair-generated amino acid syrups in soy sauce production due to international pressure.", "200": "After Hillary Clinton declined to debate Bernie Sanders in California, Donald Trump expressed interest in debating Sanders, suggesting it could raise $10-15 million for charity, including women's health issues. Trump's team was in talks with networks to host the debate in a large arena. However, Trump later changed his mind, stating that it would be inappropriate to debate the second-place finisher and instead wanted to wait for the Democratic Party's first-place finisher, likely Hillary Clinton. Trump's initial openness to debating Sanders was seen as a way to put Clinton in a bind, but ultimately did not materialize.", "217": "There's a claim that TSA confiscated nail clippers from a U.S. soldier returning from Afghanistan on a flight full of armed soldiers. However, it's stated that nail clippers have never been prohibited by TSA. Additionally, it's mentioned that at the airport in question, military charters are processed at a facility where TSA does not have access or conduct screening operations. On the other hand, a soldier claims that they were screened by TSA and had nail clippers and a multi-tool confiscated. It's suggested that even if not prohibited, a rogue agent could still confiscate the items.", "187": "Genetic testing of Paracas skulls revealed mutations in mitochondrial DNA that are unknown to any human, primate, or animal, suggesting a new 'human-like being.' However, this finding is disputed as the results could be caused by contaminants or defects in the process. Archaeologists propose that the cone-shaped skulls are a result of a tradition of skull modification practiced by ancient tribes for beauty, group cohesion, or to signal trust and connection. The shape of the skull can be attributed to intentional deformation, a common practice in some ancient cultures, contradicting the claim of alien origin.", "142": "Kellogg's has been accused of adding traces of peanut flour to some of its products, including Nutri Grain Apple Cobbler Fruit Crunch Bars, Keebler, and Austin cracker varieties. Although the company initially denied the claim, it was later found that peanut flour was indeed added to some products. However, the company claims that this was not done to avoid complying with the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) directives. Instead, they assert that their food safety standards are in full compliance with FSMA and FDA regulations. Despite this, some speculate that the company is adding allergens to avoid compliance costs.", "193": "There is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that Bill Clinton fathered a son named Danney Williams with an Arkansas prostitute in 1985. A DNA comparison was made using the Starr Report's FBI analysis, but the results did not match, ruling out paternity. The Starr Report contains sufficient data for a valid DNA comparison, and the test results were not even close to a match. Additionally, the genetic fingerprinting test used was imprecise and would not be persuasive in court, with a paternity index of only 20-30, far below the legal threshold of 100.", "208": "Remains of US troops were disposed of in a Virginia landfill between 2003 and 2008. The practice involved cremating and incinerating unidentified body parts and dumping the ashes. At least 274 troops were treated this way, with their families unaware of the method of disposal. They were led to believe their loved ones would be disposed of in a \"respectful and dignified manner.\" The practice was ended in May 2008, and the military now buries the ashes at sea. The incident was largely ignored by the mainstream media until The Washington Post reported on it in 2011.", "175": "There have been several instances where people with personalized license plates such as 'VOID', 'UNKNOWN', 'XXXXXXX', and 'NOTAG' received notices for unpaid parking tickets. These plates were mistakenly entered into computer systems as valid license plate numbers for vehicles without plates or with unknown plates. As a result, the owners received numerous notices for tickets issued to other vehicles. In one case, a 'NOTAG' plate owner received 200 violation notices, while another with the same plate received $8,000 in parking tickets. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim about a 'NO PLATE' license plate.", "179": "CFL light bulbs do emit higher levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) than conventional incandescent bulbs. However, there is no evidence that these levels pose any health consequences. The EMF intensity falls off sharply with distance, becoming negligible after a couple of feet. The glass used in CFLs provides a UV filtering effect, and additional materials or distance can further reduce exposure. Studies have found that CFLs do not pose a significant risk of acute injury to the eyes or skin compared to incandescent lamps. The current evidence does not support a link between EMF exposure and health problems.", "149": "Dorothy Dandridge, a black entertainer, faced racial prejudice in 1950s Las Vegas. Despite being a headliner, she was not allowed to stay in hotels or use their facilities, including pools. In 1953, at the Last Frontier Hotel, she was told not to go near the pool, or it would be drained. Defying the rule, she dipped her toe in the water, and the pool was subsequently drained and cleaned. This incident has been passed down as a symbol of the racist policies Dandridge faced. The hotel's actions were a result of complaints from white patrons.", "146": "Research suggests that the idea of menstrual synchrony, or women's menstrual cycles synchronizing when they live or work in close proximity, may be a myth. Studies have found that any apparent synchrony can be attributed to chance, with approximately half of pairs of women having onset differences that decrease over the same number of menstrual cycles due to their relative mean menstrual cycle lengths. In fact, most investigations have found no statistically significant changes in menstrual cycle synchronization among women living or working together. Only a few pairs of women showed narrowing cycle start dates over time, while most had larger differences.", "180": "There have been reports of a possible gang initiation ruse where individuals cause a rear-end collision and then attack the driver. Some law enforcement officials have issued public alerts warning of this potential threat, citing credible information and a recent incident where a driver was shot after being rear-ended. However, other authorities have investigated these claims and found no evidence to substantiate them, labeling it an urban legend. Despite this, officials are advising drivers not to get out of their vehicle if rear-ended and instead call 911 or drive to a police station.", "219": "There is no evidence to support the claim of \"no-go zones\" in France, Britain, and the US, where local laws are not applicable and Sharia Law operates. Some areas in these countries have high crime rates, but this is not unique to Muslim communities. Visits to predominantly immigrant and Muslim areas in Europe found them to be unthreatening and routine, with order prevailing. The concept of \"no-go zones\" is inaccurate, and there is no credible information to support the assertion that certain areas exclude individuals based solely on their religion. Such claims have been widely criticized and apologized for.", "215": "The claim that the NRA banned the carrying of guns from their own national convention is partially true. Attendees with proper licenses were allowed to carry firearms in the Music City Center in accordance with Tennessee law. However, guns were prohibited in the Bridgestone Arena, where an NRA-sponsored concert was held, due to the arena's pre-existing laws. The NRA did require display guns to have their firing pins removed for safety reasons, but this did not apply to attendees' self-defense weapons. The organization followed federal and state laws regarding gun sales and background checks.", "47": "A TV weatherman, Mike Seidel, was initially thought to be caught urinating in the bushes live on camera. He was supposed to give an outdoor forecast in Sugar Mountain, North Carolina, but a video appeared to show him relieving himself instead. However, it was later clarified that Seidel was not urinating, but rather had lost contact with the control room and was dialing his phone. He was seen hunched over with his back to the camera, leading to the misconception. An apology was requested from social media critics who spread the misinformation about the weatherman's actions.", "45": "Mike Seidel, a Weather Channel meteorologist, was involved in an incident that sparked rumors he was caught urinating on live TV. However, it was later clarified that Seidel was not relieving himself, but rather, he lost contact with the control room and was dialing his phone. He was hunched over, which led to the misunderstanding. Some reports claim that Seidel was indeed caught with his pants down and was relieving himself in the bushes before presenting his segment. Seidel was seen doing up his flies and putting his gloves back on, contradicting the initial clarification.", "164": "There is a claim that Starbucks has joined Monsanto in a lawsuit against Vermont to avoid GMO labeling regulations. Some sources state that Starbucks is part of a lawsuit aiming to block a law requiring genetically modified ingredients to be labeled, and that it is hiding behind the Grocery Manufacturers Association. However, it is also stated that Starbucks has teamed up with Monsanto to sue Vermont. On the other hand, it is claimed that Starbucks is not part of any lawsuit pertaining to GMO labeling, has not provided funding for any campaign, and has not taken a position on the issue.", "162": "The name of the annual Moomba festival in Melbourne, Australia, is believed to have originated from an Aboriginal word. However, the meaning of the word is disputed. Some claim it means \"Let's get together and have fun,\" which was the intention of the city fathers when they chose the name. In contrast, others argue that the word \"Moomba\" actually has a derogatory meaning, with \"Moom\" translating to \"buttocks\" or \"anus\" and the suffix \"ba\" meaning \"at,\" \"in,\" or \"on,\" effectively rendering the phrase to mean \"up your bum\" or a similar phrase.", "205": "There is a claim that a carbon monoxide spike on the west coast indicates a massive earthquake will soon hit. Some research suggests that the earth emits a burst of carbon monoxide a few days before an earthquake, which could be used as a precursor signal for an early warning system. However, others argue that the recent spike is due to stagnant air, smog, and pollution from fires, and not related to the San Andreas fault. Additionally, experts emphasize that no one can predict earthquakes and that there is no reliable indicator to say when one will occur.", "194": "There is an Islamic tribunal operating in the Dallas area that uses Sharia as a basis for law, but it is a non-profit organization and its rulings are nonbinding. The tribunal claims that Sharia is mostly in agreement with Texas laws, and if there is a conflict, parties can take the matter to Texas civil courts. Participation is voluntary, but the social ramifications of rejecting the tribunal's decision are unclear. Despite this, the tribunal does not usurp state or federal law, and similar religious mediation services exist for other faiths. Sharia law has not been established as a jurisdiction in Texas.", "163": "A Michigan farmer claimed to have been forced to destroy 40,000 edible cherries to make way for imported cherries. However, it was found that the farmer was not required to destroy the cherries, but rather, the processor made the decision to ask the farmer to dump them. The decision was based on a federal marketing order that aims to stabilize prices and supply. The order required processors to keep 29% of the crop off traditional markets, but farmers can use the dumped cherries for research, development, or donate them to charity. The claim that the farmer was not allowed to donate or use the cherries is false.", "151": "Some studies suggest a link between induced abortion and breast cancer, with one study finding a low but significant increase in risk. However, this association may be distorted by reporting bias, as women with breast cancer may be more likely to disclose their abortion history. Regional differences in reporting also suggest bias. Conversely, multiple studies have found no association between abortion and breast cancer risk. In fact, several well-designed studies have concluded that the risk of breast cancer is not materially affected by abortion. The scientific consensus is that induced abortion is not associated with an increased breast cancer risk.", "213": "The family of Anne Frank sought refugee status in the United States but was denied. They tried to secure visas to the US and Cuba for nine months, with Otto Frank reaching out to his university friend Nathan Straus Jr. for help. Straus contacted the State Department and arranged for affidavits from employers in Massachusetts. However, the US had restrictions in place, including a rule that no refugee with close relatives in Europe could enter the country. This rule, added in 1941, ended the possibility of the Frank family obtaining visas. A visa was eventually granted to Otto Frank, but it was canceled after Germany declared war on the US.", "155": "Organ donations do not occur while the donor is still alive, as the law requires donors to be determined dead before organs can be removed. Brain dead individuals, who are legally dead, are often used as donors and cannot experience pain or suffering. The sensation of pain requires upper-level brain function, which is absent in brain dead individuals. In some cases, donors may still have a heartbeat, but this does not mean they are alive or can feel pain. In non-heart beating donations, the patient is removed from life support and allowed to die before organs are harvested.", "27": "There were reports of a bird defecating on Vladimir Putin during a speech in Moscow at the dedication of a new monument to the First World War. However, footage of the incident was later found to be fake. Other videos and pictures from the event show no evidence of the bird's droppings on Putin's shoulder or suit. In fact, multiple international agencies' photos and unaltered videos of the event, including Putin laying a wreath and speaking at the ceremony, show his suit to be perfectly clean. This suggests that the incident did not occur.", "201": "There have been reports of \"sex roulette\" parties where one person secretly has HIV and no one wears condoms, often attended by gay men seeking a thrill. Doctors in Barcelona have seen a rise in such parties, warning that people have \"lost respect\" for HIV. The parties allegedly originated in Serbia and are also known as \"blue\" parties where attendees take antiviral drugs to reduce transmission risk. However, the logistics of organizing such parties are questioned, and there is limited evidence to support the reports. Some consider it an urban legend with no hard evidence beyond a few isolated cases.", "137": "Facebook workers allegedly suppressed conservative news stories from the trending section, preventing topics like CPAC and Mitt Romney from appearing despite being organically popular. They were also instructed to \"inject\" selected stories, even if not popular, and exclude news about Facebook itself. However, an investigation found no evidence to support this claim. Former contractors revealed they were encouraged to promote neutral headlines and select articles from preferred media outlets, avoiding sites like Breitbart and The Blaze, but not explicitly told to suppress them. Some curators denied consciously suppressing conservative news, with no evidence of management involvement.", "196": "A federal lawsuit in Wisconsin alleges that a school district instructed guidance counselors to have a 16-year-old transgender boy and other transgender students wear bright green wristbands to monitor their restroom usage. The student felt the wristband would be a visible badge of his transgender status, threatening his safety and leading to ridicule. However, the school district denies having a practice or policy requiring students to wear wristbands for monitoring purposes, stating that some allegations in the complaint are patently false and that they have worked with transgender students to address their unique needs and accommodations.", "150": "Peanut oil has been used in vaccines since the 1960s as a growth medium and adjuvant. It was first used in flu vaccines to enhance their strength and became a preferred adjuvant by the 1980s. However, its use has been discontinued in some cases due to reactogenicity and concerns over potential carcinogenicity. Despite this, research has continued into the development of peanut oil-based adjuvants, with some formulas showing promise in inducing protective immunity without adverse reactions. While peanut oil is not listed as an ingredient, it is present in some vaccines in trace amounts, according to regulatory agencies.", "224": "President Obama is portrayed as making the hard decision to order the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, despite significant doubts. He is credited with shouldering the burden of the operation and asking all the right questions. However, there are claims that Obama attempted to stop or delay the operation and did not leave the golf course until 20 minutes before the SEAL Team 6 took out bin Laden. Despite this, Obama is also reported to have privately thanked the Navy SEALs for a \"job well done\" and recognized the full assault force with the Presidential Unit Citation.", "202": "Mississippi has passed the \"Mississippi Church Protection Act,\" allowing churches to create security programs and designate members to carry concealed weapons. These designated members will have criminal and legal protections, including immunity from civil liability if their actions result in death, which is considered justifiable homicide. The bill also expands concealed carry laws in the state. However, critics argue that this legislation puts \"soldiers of God\" above the law, allowing them to act as judge, jury, and executioner. It effectively recognizes churches as sovereign entities with the power to kill.", "182": "Swallowing active dry yeast before drinking alcohol is claimed to prevent intoxication, but this method is highly implausible. Yeast's alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is inactive at the stomach's low pH, making it unlikely to aid in alcohol breakdown. Furthermore, excessive yeast consumption could lead to increased toxic byproducts and worsen hangovers. Some individuals claim to have successfully used this method, feeling only a slight buzz after consuming multiple beers with yeast. However, these claims are anecdotal, and there is no concrete evidence to support the effectiveness of this method in preventing intoxication. Its validity remains doubtful.", "206": "Some doctors believe the increased microcephaly cases in Brazil are linked to the use of a Monsanto-associated pesticide, Pyriproxyfen, added to drinking water in 2014. They argue that the spatial distribution of affected areas correlates with the use of this chemical, and that the Ministry of Health ignores the role of chemical control in the epidemic. However, others argue that there is no evidence to support this claim, and that the pesticide is used in many places without an increase in microcephaly cases. The pesticide is also considered safe by the EPA and breaks down in sunlight.", "214": "Research suggests that the abortion pill reversal procedure may not be effective in interrupting or undoing a pregnancy termination in progress. Women who take only the first pill already have a 30-50% chance of continuing their pregnancy normally. Progesterone, used in the reversal procedure, may not improve the odds of fetal survival, as the abortion pill binds more tightly to progesterone receptors. However, some studies report successful reversals with progesterone treatment, with 4 out of 6 women carrying their pregnancies to term. The effectiveness of the procedure remains unclear due to limited and low-quality research.", "198": "Top Obama administration officials gathered in the Oval Office, listening to phone calls from American defenders and watching real-time video of the Benghazi attack, yet they sent no military aid to intervene. However, it is reported that the President ordered the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to do everything possible to protect Americans, including using military force. The Secretary of Defense testified that he ordered identified assets to deploy immediately after the President's orders. The administration was studying video footage from the consulate and a surveillance drone to understand the attack and identify the attackers.", "189": "It's a normal procedure for ambassadors to submit their resignations at the end of a presidential term. However, what's unusual is the lack of exceptions or extensions being granted. Typically, administrations allow a handful of ambassadors to stay in place for weeks or months, especially those with school-age children. In this case, a blanket edict was issued requiring all politically appointed ambassadors to leave by Inauguration Day without exceptions, breaking with decades of precedent. This move may leave the US without Senate-confirmed envoys in critical nations for months. The order is seen as a hard line against the previous administration.", "212": "Sarah Furay, a 19-year-old, was arrested for possessing and manufacturing controlled substances. Her father, Bill Furay, is a DEA agent, sparking speculation that her connection helped her avoid charges. Initially, it seemed plausible as she was released after just one day in jail and no indictment was filed for months. However, it was revealed that the delay was due to a state issue, with the Texas Department of Public Safety's labs being backed up. Eventually, Furay was indicted with four felony counts related to dealing drugs, contradicting the claim that her father's connection helped her avoid charges.", "244": "A YouTuber gave a homeless man $100 and secretly filmed him to see how he would spend it. The homeless man, Thomas, surprised him by buying food and sharing it with other homeless people. The video went viral, raising over $130,000 for the homeless. However, an eyewitness claims that the video was staged and Thomas knew he was being filmed. The YouTuber has been accused of creating a well-filmed prank, but the authenticity of the video remains unclear. Despite the controversy, the video has done some good, raising a significant amount of money for a good cause.", "209": "A resident wrote to the newspaper to complain about a \"morning air show\" of four F-16 jets flying low over the area, questioning the purpose of the flyby. However, it was later revealed that the jets were on a mission to a memorial service for a fallen serviceman, Air Force Capt. Jeremy Fresques, who was killed in Iraq. The flyby was a display of respect and a four-ship formation is a tradition the Air Force pays to those who give their lives in defense of freedom. The resident later apologized for his initial complaint, citing his lack of knowledge about the event.", "222": "US troops deployed overseas are no longer provided with hot breakfast at some bases, instead receiving MREs. The change is due to the lowest attendance at breakfast and the Army's need to cut back on several items in anticipation of base closures. However, it's stated that this decision has nothing to do with national budget cuts, but rather with the responsible reduction of forces. Most dining facilities still offer takeaway items like cereal and granola bars to supplement MREs. The majority of service members in Afghanistan are still receiving hot breakfast, with MREs only being used at a few closing bases.", "323": "A woman named Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist, claimed to have spent $20,000 on a third breast implant to become unattractive to men and gain fame. She contacted over 50 doctors before finding one willing to perform the surgery. However, evidence later revealed that the third breast was likely a prosthetic, not an actual implant. A stolen luggage report listed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" among the contents, casting doubt on Tridevil's claim. It appears that the third breast was not a real implant, but rather a fake one, supporting the claim that \"Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie.", "197": "There is no evidence to support the claim that Black Lives Matter protesters in Baton Rouge chanted calls for \"dead cops... now\" shortly before three officers were killed in that city. The claim appears to be based on a video taken in New York, not Baton Rouge. A forensic audio analyst verified the authenticity of the video, confirming the chant \"dead cops... now\" was made by a small group of protesters in New York. However, this group was not part of the main Black Lives Matter protest and their chant was not representative of the larger movement.", "195": "President Bill Clinton had his hair cut on Air Force One at Los Angeles International Airport in 1993 by Beverly Hills hairstylist Cristophe. Initially, it was reported that this caused significant delays, with two runways shut down and incoming flights delayed, tying up air traffic. However, further investigation revealed that these reports were incorrect. Federal Aviation Administration records showed no significant delays of regularly scheduled passenger flights, no circling planes, and only one unscheduled air taxi flight was delayed by two minutes. The closure of two runways did not cause any problems due to light traffic.", "174": "Andy Kaufman's brother initially suggested the comedian may have faked his own death, but later backpedaled, stating he was misquoted and is skeptical about the claim. A press release in 2004 claimed Kaufman was alive, but the person responsible later admitted to fabricating the story. A friend of Kaufman's, Bob Zmuda, believes Kaufman may have used a body double to fake his death, but this theory has not been proven.

He had removed his gloves to dial and tucked them between his knees to prevent them from blowing away. The incident was misinterpreted, and Seidel has been vindicated. The claim that he was writing his name in the snow is entirely false.", "223": "Neil Armstrong claimed that his historic \"one small step\" remark was misquoted, saying he intended to say \"one small step for a man.\" He believed the article \"a\" was omitted due to static in the transmission. This omission slightly changed the meaning of his words. However, journalists at the time were unsure if he said \"a man\" or \"man\" and decided to report it without the article. Later, a commemorative recording of the flight also did not capture the \"a.\" Some argue that Armstrong's tone and inflection suggest he caught the mistake immediately, while others claim he did say \"a man\" but it was lost in transmission.", "97": "Joan Rivers' doctor, Gwen Korovin, denies taking a selfie with the unconscious comedian and performing an unauthorized biopsy. However, clinic employees claim Korovin took the photo and performed the procedure, stating she said Rivers \"will think this is funny\" or \"would love this.\" Rivers stopped breathing when her vocal cords swelled during the biopsy, leading to cardiac arrest. The biopsy was not authorized as Rivers never signed a consent form. Korovin's lawyer maintains her client is a respected doctor who does not discuss patients publicly, citing confidentiality laws. The incident is under investigation, with Rivers' daughter considering a lawsuit.", "204": "There is conflicting information about the legitimacy of civil rights-era photos of Bernie Sanders. Some claim the photos are genuine, with one photographer stating they took the picture of Sanders speaking to fellow CORE members at a sit-in, and another photographer, Danny Lyon, confirming the photo's authenticity after discovering new evidence. However, others dispute this, with four University of Chicago alumni and an archivist initially claiming the photo was not of Sanders, but rather Bruce Rappaport. Additionally, Rep. John Lewis questioned Sanders' participation in the civil rights movement, stating he never saw or met Sanders at any events.", "165": "Centerville Elementary School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, canceled its Christmas play. Contrary to claims, the decision was not made due to two parents complaining about a reference to God. Instead, the school stated that the play was canceled because it consumed a significant amount of instructional time, approximately 20 hours. The school explored alternative solutions, such as rehearsals after school hours, but none were implemented. There were no complaints about the play's content, and the decision was made to prioritize instructional time. A rumor about a Jewish family influencing the decision and fleeing the county was also found to be untrue.", "239": "Christian Bale was initially set to play Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, with the screenwriter confirming his involvement in an interview. However, Bale has now reportedly withdrawn from the project, deciding he wasn't right for the part after much deliberation.

The role of Steve Jobs remains open, with actors such as Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper previously rumored for the part.", "167": "There is a claim that an eyeball-licking fad has led to a widespread outbreak of ocular maladies among Japanese schoolchildren. Some reports suggest that this fad, also known as oculolinctus, is spreading pink eye and eye chlamydia among students, with one third of children in a class admitting to the practice.

The eyewitness recognized Lin from his previous prank videos and saw a cameraman in the passenger seat.

Groucho asked her why she had so many children, and after her response, he replied, \"I love my cigar too, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while.\" The studio audience loved it, but the exchange was edited out of the radio broadcast due to its racy nature. The incident occurred before the show's TV debut and no copies of the outtake are known to have survived.", "181": "Ongoing tetanus vaccine campaigns in Kenya have sparked controversy, with some claiming they are a ruse to sterilize women of childbearing age. However, evidence suggests that the campaigns aim to eliminate neonatal tetanus, which disproportionately affects mothers and newborns in Africa and Southern Asia due to inadequate immunization and poor healthcare. Testing of vaccines has shown false positive results for hCG due to inappropriate testing methods, while validated tests have found no evidence of hCG. The vaccine is administered to women of childbearing age to protect them and their unborn children from tetanus.", "203": "The FDA has taken action against CBD oil manufacturers, claiming they are selling \"adulterated products\" due to the presence of CBDs. However, it appears the FDA's real concern is the marketing of CBD products for medical uses, which is only allowed for approved drugs. The FDA has sent warning letters to companies making health claims about their CBD products, stating they are violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA's actions seem to be motivated by the fact that CBD is being investigated as a new drug, with two drug applications currently under consideration, potentially giving a monopoly to a drug company.", "145": "Reports of animals fleeing Yellowstone Park have sparked concerns of an imminent supervolcano eruption. However, some experts attribute the migration to the depth of winter, with animals seeking food at lower elevations, only to return when the snow melts. A video also shows bison running into the park, not away from it, contradicting the claim. On the other hand, some experts suggest that animals may have an instinct to sense impending disaster, citing the 2006 tsunami as an example. Despite this, seismologists and researchers agree that there is no evidence to support an imminent eruption.", "183": "An academic study suggested that Hillary Clinton received around 834,000 net votes from non-citizens in the 2016 presidential election, based on an estimated 6.4% turnout among 20 million adult non-citizens. However, this number is far short of President Trump's claim of up to 5 million illegal voters. The study's findings indicate that while non-citizen votes may have added to Clinton's margin, they could not account for the entire nationwide popular vote margin. Critics argue that the study's assumptions may be flawed, and another study found that some respondents provided incorrect answers about their citizenship status.", "116": "Apple plans to shut down Beats Music, a streaming service it acquired in May for $3 billion, according to some reports.

They argue that spiders don't crawl under human skin, and the claim lacks evidence, as the spider itself was not presented. The experts suggest that another organism, such as a tick or mite, could be responsible for Thomas's symptoms.", "226": "The claim that the federal government provides a much greater monthly allowance to refugees than to retirees is false. Refugees do not receive more financial assistance than Canadian pensioners. A one-time start-up payment to some refugees was mistaken for an ongoing monthly payment, leading to the spread of misinformation. In reality, government-assisted refugees receive a temporary monthly allowance based on provincial social assistance rates, which is lower than what pensioners receive.
