The origin of the story seems linked to a satirical website and stock photos, leading to widespread debate and subsequent debunking of the priest's purported narrative.", "328": "There are conflicting accounts regarding the adoption of Yair Tawil by Argentina's president to prevent him from turning into a werewolf due to a centuries-old legend about seventh sons. While some sources suggest that the adoption was based on this legend, others claim that the adoption tradition is separate from the werewolf myth and was aimed at countering superstitions. The law allowing presidential adoptions was originally for Catholic children but has been expanded to include children from other religions, such as in the case of Tawil being the first Jewish godson adopted.", "97": "The controversy surrounding Joan Rivers' death involves conflicting reports about whether her doctor took a selfie with her while she was unconscious and performed an unauthorized biopsy.

Despite existing practices like gender separation in public spaces, the airline's decision remains unconfirmed and could be misinterpreted amid cultural context.", "291": "The claim that a woman named Jasmine Tridevil had a third breast implanted to become less attractive to men is supported by her own statements about undergoing surgery and her desire to have a reality TV show. However, evidence against the claim includes suspicions raised by Snopes.com and the discovery of a police report listing a \"3 breast prosthesis\" in Tridevil's stolen luggage, indicating the third breast may have been a hoax. Furthermore, it was reported that her third breast was not a true implant but a prosthetic.", "63": "Several news articles and videos have surfaced claiming that a bird defecated on Vladimir Putin during a speech at a World War I monument unveiling. However, multiple sources have debunked this claim as a fake video, providing evidence that the footage was manipulated.

Despite Tridevil's claims and aspirations, skepticism remains regarding the authenticity of her third breast augmentation.", "322": "The claim that a woman underwent surgery to add a third breast has been exposed as a hoax. Evidence includes a stolen luggage report listing a \"3 breast prosthesis,\" contradictory statements by the woman known as Jasmine Tridevil, skepticism from urban legends website Snopes, and indications of seeking sensationalism for a reality TV show rather than genuine intent. The woman claimed the procedure was done to make herself unattractive to men, but inconsistencies in her story and lack of medical ethics support the conclusion that the whole scenario was fabricated.", "17": "CNN has aired an audio recording alleged to capture the shots fired at Michael Brown, sparking doubts from experts who question its authenticity.

The hoax email claiming a secret speed enforcement system on Westlink M7 has been dismissed, with Westlink enforcing speed limits through standard policing measures and signage.", "275": "Several news articles and reports suggest that the claim of a woman having a third breast surgically implanted is likely a hoax.
