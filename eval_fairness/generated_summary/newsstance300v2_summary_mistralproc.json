The documents suggest that one way in which embezzlers can steal large amounts of money is by stealing small sums from many different accounts. The first document describes how a programmer used the \"salami technique\" to steal small amounts of money from a company's sales commission accounts. The second document describes how an embezzler used the same technique to steal small amounts of money from checking accounts at a bank. The third document describes how two programmers used the technique to steal small amounts of money from their colleagues' paychecks. The fourth document describes how two programmers used the technique to steal two cents per employee per week for federal taxes.

The major health claim being made against CFLs, that they put out \"dirty electricity\" which can allegedly cause a variety of health problems, is not supported by the available evidence. The glass used in CFLs already provides a UV filtering effect, and any additional glass, or plastic, or fabric used in lighting fixtures that is between you and the CFL will further reduce the already low levels to still lower levels since these materials act as additional UV filters. The EMF falls off sharply with distance, even after a couple of feet the EMF put out by light bulbs falls from tiny by many orders of magnitude to negligible. The UVR At 30 cm, single envelope CFLs have a maximum daily UVR exposure similar to the test results for a 60W incandescent lamp.

The donor must be determined to be dead before organs can be removed, meaning that they must have either had their heart stop permanently or been determined to be brain dead. The tests done to confirm brain death check many different things, including that there is no drive to breathe and no response to noxious stimuli. In the case of a middle aged healthy man who fell off the stairs and lost consciousness, the patient was kept sedated and intubated in the ICU and was not brain death, but parts of his brain still worked. In this case, the patient was not anesthetized and the organs were removed after the patient died.

The report tells us that Obama had given clear directions to his secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to do everything possible to protect Americans. The Obama administration had already deployed military assets to Libya before the attacks started. Video footage from the United States consulate in Benghazi shows an organized group of armed men attacking the compound. The Secretary of State recalled that the President made clear that they ought to use all of the resources at their disposal to try to make sure they did everything possible to try to save lives there.

However, some groups of doctors argue that other factors such as mosquitoes, poverty, social marginalization, deforestation, and climate change may be contributing to the problem. The pesticide theory was initiated by a small group of physicians, and the mainstream groups have not done any epidemiology to demonstrate that people exposed to the pesticide are more likely to have babies with microcephaly. On the other hand, an open letter to the people of Brazil published by the Brazilian Association for Collective Health argues that the widespread epidemic in the Pacific and the current epidemic in Colombia, which resulted in no cases of malformations, much less microcephaly, despite the widespread use of pyriproxyfen in both countries, indicates that the pesticide is not the cause of microcephaly in Brazil.
