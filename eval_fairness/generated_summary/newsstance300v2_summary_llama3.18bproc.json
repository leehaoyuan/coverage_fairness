{"173": "A bank employee embezzled a large amount of money by stealing small sums from many different accounts. The embezzler used the bank's computer to transfer small amounts, typically twenty or thirty cents, from 300 checking accounts to a dummy account for their personal use. They were careful not to divert sums from any particular account more often than three times a year to avoid detection. The scheme allowed them to quietly accumulate a substantial amount of money over time, as neither the bank nor the depositors noticed the small discrepancies. This method of embezzlement, known as the \"salami technique,\" involves rounding down fractional sums to the nearest whole number and diverting the surplus to a dummy account.", "143": "Investigations revealed that some cheap soy sauce is made from amino acid syrups, which can be derived from human hair, including from barber shop floors, hospitals, and salons. A journalist investigation exposed a manufacturing practice where human hair was used to make a condiment with a flavor similar to soy sauce. Although the hair was not specifically from Chinese convicts, the use of human hair in soy sauce production has raised concerns about food safety and authenticity. The Chinese government banned this practice due to domestic and international pressure. However, the exact origin of the hair remains unclear.", "200": "Donald Trump expressed interest in debating Bernie Sanders after Hillary Clinton refused to participate in a final debate. Trump proposed conditions for the debate, including raising 10-15 million dollars for charity, specifically women's health issues, and hosting it in a large arena. He stated that he would \"love to\" debate Sanders, but later changed his stance, deciding to wait for the Democratic nominee, likely Hillary Clinton, citing the Democratic nominating process as rigged. Trump's initial openness to debating Sanders was met with skepticism, but he continued to entertain the prospect.", "217": "The claim that TSA confiscated nail clippers from a U.S. soldier returning from Afghanistan on a flight full of armed soldiers is disputed. It is stated that nail clippers were never prohibited by TSA, and the agency does not conduct screening operations at the remote transit terminal where military charters arrive. In fact, nail clippers are allowed, and a myth about their prohibition has been debunked. However, there are accounts from individuals claiming that they were indeed confiscated, citing a separate screening process by TSA personnel at the facility. The validity of these claims is unclear.", "187": "The claim that cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien origin is a topic of debate. Genetic testing on the skulls revealed mutations unknown to any human, primate, or animal on Earth, suggesting a completely new, non-human species. However, experts argue that the DNA results are inconclusive, possibly due to contaminants or defects in the process. Another theory suggests that the cone-shaped skulls could be a result of intentional deformation, which may have been practiced for group cohesion or signaling in a resource-scarce region. Archaeologists attribute the skulls to a human from a 2,000-4,000-year-old settlement, with the shape being a result of a tribal tradition.", "142": "Kellogg's has been accused of adding traces of peanut flour to its products to avoid complying with the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) directives. However, the company has denied these claims, stating that food safety is a top priority and they are fully compliant with FSMA and FDA regulations. They have controls in place to prevent allergen cross-contamination and proper labeling of allergens on their foods. Despite this, some sources believe that Kellogg's is adding minute quantities of peanut flour to its products, including Keebler and Austin cracker varieties, to avoid compliance costs.", "193": "The claim that Bill Clinton fathered an illegitimate, mixed-race son named Danney Williams with an Arkansas prostitute in 1985 is disputed. DNA analysis using the Starr Report's data showed no match between Clinton's DNA and Danney's, ruling out paternity. A genetic fingerprint test found Clinton to be only 20-30 times more likely than a random Caucasian male to be Danney's father, which is not conclusive. This is below the legal threshold of 100. The mother's story of a relationship with Clinton has been debunked by science, and the boy himself is said to be holding up well after learning the truth, suggesting that the allegations may have been a cruel hoax.", "208": "Between 2003 and 2008, the Dover Air Force Base mortuary disposed of portions of troops' remains by cremating and dumping the ashes in a Virginia landfill. The practice was limited to fragments or portions of body parts that were unable to be identified or were later recovered from the battlefield. Family members had authorized the military to make \"appropriate disposition\" of such remains. The military now cremates unclaimed and unidentified body parts and buries the ashes at sea, a change made in May 2008. The practice of dumping remains in a landfill was not disclosed to relatives of fallen service members.", "175": "Several individuals have received thousands of unpaid parking tickets due to their personalized license plates that seem to contradict the purpose of a license plate. Richard Turner's \"VOID\" plate and Ralph August's \"UNKNOWN\" plate led to a barrage of parking tickets, while Jim Cara's \"NOTAG\" plate resulted in over 200 violation notices. Carol Schroeder's \"NOTAG\" plate earned her $8,000 in parking tickets. In each case, the city's computer system interpreted the plate numbers as a legitimate plate number, leading to the issuance of numerous tickets. The individuals have been left to deal with the consequences of their humorous license plates.", "179": "Research suggests that CFL light bulbs do not pose a significant health hazard compared to conventional incandescent bulbs due to higher levels of radiation. Studies have shown that CFLs emit EMF in certain frequencies, but at a distance, this radiation falls off sharply and becomes negligible. Additionally, the glass used in CFLs provides a UV filtering effect, and further materials like glass, plastic, or fabric can reduce radiation levels even more. Scientific evidence also indicates that low-level electromagnetic fields do not cause health problems, and the World Health Organization has concluded that current evidence does not confirm any health consequences from exposure to these fields.", "149": "In the 1950s, Las Vegas hotels enforced strict racial segregation policies, prohibiting African Americans from using hotel rooms, restaurants, casinos, showrooms, and even pools. Notorious was the incident involving black entertainer Dorothy Dandridge, who was booked at the prestigious Last Frontier Hotel in 1953. She was told not to use the pool, and the hotel management would drain it if she did. The hotel even went as far as to close the pool and post a maintenance sign if Dandridge hinted at wanting to swim. This racial prejudice was a common experience for many African American performers, including Dandridge, during that era.", "146": "Research suggests that women's menstrual cycles do not synchronize when living or working in close proximity to one another. Many studies have found that the decrease in onset differences between pairs of subjects over time is due to chance factors, and that randomly paired subjects' onset differences remain constant, increase, or decrease over the first several onsets. A study analyzing over 360 pairs of women found that most pairs had a larger difference in cycle start dates at the end of the study than at the beginning, contradicting the idea of synchronization. In fact, no statistically significant changes were found in any comparisons made, and the mean differences observed were close to the expected mean difference of 7.5 days.", "180": "There have been reports of a gang initiation ritual where members bump into cars and then shoot the drivers who get out. A Buffalo Police Commissioner issued a public alert after a shooting incident, stating that a man was shot after getting out of his car after being bumped by another vehicle. However, police in other areas have dismissed these claims as an \"urban legend\" with no credible evidence to support them. Despite this, warnings have been issued in several cities, advising drivers to be cautious and not to get out of their cars if they are involved in a rear-end collision.", "219": "The claim that localities in the United States, France, and Britain are considered Muslim \"no-go zones\" operating under Sharia Law is disputed. Some sources describe these areas as \"sensitive urban zones\" that are unthreatening in normal times but can erupt with unpredictable violence, such as car burnings and attacks on authorities. Others argue that these areas are not formally designated as no-go zones and that there is no credible information to support the assertion that they exclude individuals based solely on their religion. However, some sources suggest that these areas exist in Europe and are characterized by high Muslim density, Shariah courts, and limited government sovereignty.", "215": "The National Rifle Association (NRA) allowed attendees to bring guns to their national convention, but with certain conditions. Attendees could carry firearms in the Music City Center with proper licenses, following Tennessee law. However, the NRA requested that attendees not bring guns to the Bridgestone Arena for a scheduled concert, as it prohibits firearm possession. Display guns at the convention had firing pins removed for safety reasons, but attendees' self-defense weapons were not affected. The NRA followed federal and state laws regarding gun sales, allowing attendees to purchase firearms and have them transferred to local dealers after background checks.", "47": "A video of TV weatherman Mike Seidel has gone viral, appearing to show him urinating in the bushes during a live outdoor forecast. However, it has been clarified that he was not actually relieving himself, but rather lost contact with the control room and was dialing his phone. Seidel was hunched over, which led to the misconception. NBC News anchor Lester Holt cut to Seidel, but he was not ready, and Seidel was seen putting his gloves back on and doing up his flies. The incident has been cleared up, with Seidel being vindicated and social media apologizing for spreading false information.", "45": "Mike Seidel, a Weather Channel meteorologist, was involved in a viral video that sparked rumors he was caught urinating on live TV. However, it was later clarified that he was not relieving himself, but rather, lost contact with the control room and was dialing his phone while hunched over. He was mistakenly thought to be writing his name in the snow or urinating, but in reality, he was simply trying to make a phone call. This clears Seidel's name, and he was vindicated by NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams, who apologized to Seidel on his behalf.", "164": "A lawsuit has been filed by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which includes Starbucks, to challenge Vermont's mandatory GMO labeling law. The lawsuit claims the law is a \"costly and misguided measure\" that will create a \"50 state patchwork\" of labeling policies, and that it exceeds the state's authority under the US Constitution. Starbucks has denied being part of the lawsuit, stating it is not aligned with Monsanto and has not taken a position on GMO labeling, preferring a national solution. However, a petition claims Starbucks has teamed up with Monsanto to sue Vermont, alleging that the company is hiding behind the Grocery Manufacturers' Association.", "162": "The name of the annual Moomba festival in Melbourne, Australia, is a topic of controversy regarding its origins. The name is claimed to be derived from an Aboriginal word, with some sources suggesting it means \"Let's get together and have fun.\" However, other accounts reveal a different meaning, with \"Moom\" or \"Mum\" referring to buttocks or anus in various Victorian Aboriginal languages, and the suffix \"ba\" meaning \"at,\" \"in,\" or \"on.\" This interpretation implies that the name could be translated to \"Up your bum.\" The authenticity of the festival's claim of a positive meaning is disputed, leaving the true origins of the name unclear.", "205": "A Carbon Monoxide spike on the west coast does not necessarily indicate that a massive earthquake will soon hit. According to some experts, high CO levels are associated with other factors such as stagnant air, pollution from fires, and emissions from ground storage. In fact, elevated CO concentrations in California were found to be incorrect due to errors in satellite observations. Furthermore, geophysicists have improved measurements over the years and no reliable method has been proven to predict earthquakes using CO levels. As a result, there is no scientific basis to support the claim that a CO spike is a precursor to an earthquake.", "194": "The claim that Sharia law has been established in a jurisdiction in Texas is disputed. An Islamic tribunal operates in the Dallas area, but its rulings are nonbinding and follow U.S. law. The tribunal is a forum for Islamic scholars to settle business disputes and other non-criminal matters, similar to Christian, Jewish, and other religious mediation services. Sharia law is not the basis for the tribunal's decisions, but rather a guideline that aligns with Texas law most of the time. However, a separate tribunal has been established as a non-profit organization in Dallas, which uses Sharia as the basis for its decisions, but participation is voluntary, and parties can take disputes to Texas civil courts if they disagree.", "163": "A Michigan farmer was not forced to destroy 40,000 edible cherries to make way for imported cherries. In fact, farmers are allowed to use dumped cherries for research and development, and can even donate them to charity after processing. The decision to destroy cherries is made by the processor, not the marketing order, which aims to stabilize prices and supply by keeping 29 percent of the crop off traditional markets. Farmers can also explore alternative options such as selling surplus cherries in overseas markets or donating them to charity, and the cherries have a short shelf life and are typically used in products like pie filling and jams.", "151": "Studies have found conflicting evidence on whether having an abortion increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. Some research suggests that induced abortion may be linked to a low but significant increase in breast cancer risk, potentially resulting in thousands of excess cases annually. However, other studies have found no association between abortion and breast cancer risk, with some even suggesting a lack of reporting bias in regions with predominantly Roman Catholic populations. A comprehensive review of existing data concluded that induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, with this conclusion ranked as \"well established.", "213": "The family of Anne Frank sought refugee status in the United States but was ultimately denied. For nine months, they tried to secure visas, initially to the U.S. and then to Cuba, but were met with restrictions and denials. Despite having powerful connections, including letters from Otto Frank to Nathan Straus Jr. and affidavits from family members, they were unable to overcome the State Department's restrictions against refugees. The family's efforts were further hindered by a new restriction added in 1941, which prohibited refugees with close relatives in Europe from entering the U.S. due to fears of Nazi blackmail.", "155": "Organ donations can occur while the donor is still alive, but not in the sense of being awake and conscious. Instead, individuals can be declared brain dead, meaning their brain function has ceased, but their body is kept alive through ventilators, which maintain oxygen flow to the organs. This allows for organ harvesting without the risk of warm ischemia. Brain dead individuals cannot experience pain due to the loss of upper-level brain function. In some cases, patients can be kept on life support while their families discuss organ donation, and the organs can be removed after death.", "27": "A video claiming to show Vladimir Putin being pooped on by a bird during a speech in Moscow was proven to be fake. Footage from the event showed no evidence of the bird's droppings on Putin's shoulder, contradicting the claim. Other videos and pictures taken at the event also showed Putin without any stains on his suit. A side-by-side comparison of the original video with unaltered footage revealed the incident to be fabricated. The evidence suggests that the bird did not actually poop on Putin, disproving the initial claim. The incident was likely an editing job to create a humorous or embarrassing scenario.", "201": "The \"sex roulette\" trend, where one attendee at an orgy is secretly HIV-positive, is a disputed claim. While some doctors and experts warn that such parties are on the rise, particularly among gay men, others argue that the idea is ridiculous and lacks evidence. A rise in reports of such parties has been observed, but these are largely based on claims from a single doctor and a psychotherapist. A separate phenomenon, known as \"bug chasing,\" where some HIV-negative men seek out HIV infection, has been reported, but it is unclear if this is directly related to the \"sex roulette\" trend.", "137": "Facebook's trending news section has been accused of suppressing conservative news in favor of liberal content. Former curators claim that they were instructed to artificially inject liberal stories into the trending section, even if they weren't popular enough, and to exclude conservative topics, such as CPAC and Rand Paul, from the section. However, Facebook denies this, stating that they have rigorous guidelines against prioritizing one viewpoint over another and have found no evidence to support the claim. Former curators also reported that they were encouraged to promote neutral headlines and exclude conservative news outlets unless they were also covered by mainstream sites.", "196": "A federal lawsuit alleges that a school district in Wisconsin instructed guidance counselors to issue bright green wristbands to transgender students, including a 16-year-old boy, to monitor and enforce their restroom usage. However, the school district denies this claim, stating that it has no policy requiring students to wear wristbands for monitoring purposes. The district asserts that it has worked with transgender students and their families to address their needs and accommodations, and is confident that its policies and practices comply with all laws. The lawsuit claims that the district's actions are discriminatory and stigmatizing towards transgender students.", "150": "Peanut oil has been used as an ingredient in vaccines since the 1960s, specifically in the flu vaccine as an adjuvant to enhance its strength. It was initially patented and used as a trade secret, not listed as an ingredient due to \"trace amounts\" remaining in the final product. However, it is also mentioned that peanut oil became the preferred adjuvant for manufacturers by the 1980s and is still used today in vaccine adjuvants, often as a trade secret to avoid listing it as an ingredient. This suggests that peanut oil is indeed present in some vaccines, including flu shots.", "224": "President Obama's decision to order the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound was portrayed as bold and brave by Adm. Bill McRaven, head of the U.S. Special Operations command, who praised the president's leadership and the national security team for their handling of the operation. However, some sources claim that Obama attempted to stop or delay the operation and did not take it seriously until the last minute, even leaving the golf course only 20 minutes before the raid. Despite this, Obama privately thanked the Navy SEALs and recognized their bravery, awarding them the Presidential Unit Citation.", "202": "Mississippi has passed a bill, known as the \"Mississippi Church Protection Act,\" which grants churches the authority to establish security programs and designate members to carry concealed weapons without permits. These designated members would be protected from civil liability if their actions result in death, with the legal standing of \"justifiable homicide,\" similar to police officers on duty. The bill also allows concealed carry in a holster without a permit and recognizes killing as a participant of a church or place of worship security team as justifiable homicide. Critics argue that this legislation effectively puts \"soldiers of God\" above the law, allowing them to act as judge, jury, and executioner.", "182": "The claim that swallowing active dry yeast before drinking alcohol will prevent you from getting drunk is largely disputed. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that this method may work, with individuals reporting reduced intoxication after consuming yeast before drinking. However, scientific studies contradict this claim, indicating that yeast ADH is not active at low pH levels, which is the environment of the stomach. In fact, studies show that ADH loses activity and zinc at acid pH, making it unlikely that yeast would effectively reduce intoxication. Furthermore, there is a risk of creating more toxic byproducts and potentially becoming drunker due to the yeast's natural production of alcohol.", "206": "Doctors have differing opinions on the cause of the increased microcephaly cases in Brazil, with some attributing it to the use of a Monsanto-manufactured pesticide, specifically pyriproxyfen. However, there is limited evidence to support this claim, and some argue that the link between the pesticide and microcephaly is based on a flawed theory. The pesticide is used in many places without a corresponding increase in microcephaly cases, and it has been used for over a decade in South America before the surge in microcephaly. In contrast, the Zika virus has been directly linked to the condition, and the spatial distribution of affected children shows a higher concentration in the poorest areas with inadequate sanitation.", "214": "The claim that a little-known \"abortion pill reversal\" procedure allows patients to interrupt or undo a pregnancy termination in progress is supported by some anecdotal evidence, such as a case series of 7 patients who received progesterone after taking the abortion pill and were able to continue their pregnancies to term. However, the scientific evidence is limited and inconclusive, with one study finding that progesterone may not significantly improve the odds of fetal survival. In fact, most women who take the first pill have a 30-50% chance of continuing their pregnancy normally without any additional treatment.", "198": "Top Obama administration officials, including the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, and their national security team, gathered in the Oval Office to watch the Benghazi attack unfold in real-time. They received phone calls from American defenders under siege and viewed video from a drone circling over the site, but no military aid was sent to intervene. However, a report states that the President gave clear directions to protect Americans, including using military force, within 90 minutes of the attack. The report also suggests that the delays in intervention were due to a \"rusty bureaucratic process\" rather than a deliberate decision to do nothing.", "189": "Donald Trump's administration issued a blanket edict requiring all politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even a briefest of grace periods. This move is unprecedented as previous administrations have often granted extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow ambassadors to remain in place for weeks or months. However, it is also noted that this practice is common for political appointees, who typically leave at the end of a president's term, and that career diplomats often remain in their posts.", "212": "Sarah Furay, a 19-year-old, was arrested for possession and manufacturing of controlled substances, with bail set at $39,000. However, she was released after a day in jail, sparking outrage due to her father's connection to the DEA. Her father, Bill Furay, is a supervisory agent who had made numerous arrests of major Houston drug dealers. Despite initial speculation that her father's connections led to her avoiding serious repercussions, the delay in charges was attributed to a state lab backlog, not her father's influence. Eight months later, Furay was indicted on four felony counts related to drug dealing, contradicting claims that she was let off due to her father's connection.", "244": "A YouTuber, known for his prank videos, secretly filmed a homeless man after giving him $100 to see how he would spend it. However, the man surprised him by using the money to buy food for others in need, instead of spending it on himself. An eyewitness claimed the man knew he was being filmed and was working with the YouTuber. The video has raised over $130,000 for homeless people, with many people donating in response to the heartwarming story. The YouTuber was initially expecting the man to waste the money, but was instead touched by his kindness and generosity, leading him to give the man an additional $100 and start a fundraising campaign for him.", "209": "A resident wrote to the newspaper to complain about a morning air show caused by a formation of F 16 jets from the local Air Force base. However, it was later revealed that the flyby was a respectful display of honor for a fallen serviceman, Air Force Capt. Jeremy Fresques, who died in Iraq. The jets were on their way to a memorial service at his gravesite, where his family and friends were mourning his loss. The Air Force pilots took their job seriously and flew a four-ship formation as a display of respect for those who give their lives in defense of freedom, and the resident later apologized for his insensitive comments, showing appreciation for the service members.", "222": "The claim that U.S. troops deployed overseas are no longer provided with breakfast due to budget cuts is partially supported by some sources. It is stated that a majority of bases are no longer providing hot breakfast chow, with soldiers instead receiving MREs or other non-hot meal items. However, this change is not attributed to budget cuts but rather to the lowest attendance at breakfast meals. On the other hand, other sources deny the claim, stating that service members in Afghanistan can still receive up to four meals a day, including breakfast, and that the change is part of a responsible drawdown of operational forces.", "323": "The claim \"Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie\" is supported by evidence that Jasmine Tridevil's third breast is not a real implant, but a prosthetic. A luggage report from the Tampa International Airport revealed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" among the stolen items, confirming suspicions that her third breast was fake. Additionally, her history of internet hoaxes and a previous incident where she staged a public stunt by making a man wear a dunce cap and a sign that said \"I beat women\" further supports the claim that she fabricated her story.", "197": "An audio analyst concluded that the video of Black Lives Matter protesters chanting \"dead cops\" was authentic and not manipulated. The chant was heard shortly before three officers were killed in Baton Rouge. However, other evidence suggests that the chant was not part of the main protest, but rather a small group of people who were not affiliated with the larger movement. The group's chant was recorded after sunset, long after the main protest had moved downtown. Additionally, a video of the chant was posted on YouTube with a banner displaying a hashtag associated with the Trayvon Martin Organizing Committee, which has been linked to violent messages.", "195": "President Bill Clinton's haircut on Air Force One at LAX in 1993 was initially reported to have caused significant delays in air traffic, with claims that two runways were shut down for nearly an hour and incoming flights were delayed. However, subsequent investigations revealed that the reports were greatly exaggerated, with FAA records showing no significant delays of regularly scheduled passenger flights. In fact, only an unscheduled air taxi flight was delayed by two minutes. The records also showed that arriving flights were simply diverted to the two other runways, and traffic was light at the time.", "174": "The claim that comedian Andy Kaufman is alive, many years after faking his death, is met with skepticism. A press release claiming Kaufman's return in 2004 was later revealed to be a hoax by Enrique Proust, who apologized for any distress caused to the Kaufman family and friends. Kaufman's brother Michael denied the allegations, stating that the family was overwhelmed by the attention and that he was as skeptical as anyone else about the claims. A long-time friend, Bob Zmuda, also disputed the claim, stating that Kaufman would have made contact if he were alive.", "355": "Christian Bale was initially considered for the role of Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, with director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin confirming his involvement. However, Bale later decided to part ways with the project, and it was reported that he wasn't right for the role.

The project is now looking for a replacement, with Seth Rogen in talks to play Steve Wozniak.", "147": "The claim that wedding guests should refrain from throwing rice at newly-wedded couples because the rice kills birds who eat it is largely unfounded. Many experts argue that rice is not harmful to birds, as it must be boiled before it expands and can be easily digested by birds. In fact, some birds, such as ducks and geese, depend on rice fields for survival. Others point out that birds have powerful muscles and grit in their gizzards that can grind up food, including rice. There is no evidence to support the claim that uncooked rice causes violent deaths in birds.", "176": "There is conflicting information regarding the installation of \"point-to-point\" cameras along highways that automatically track and ticket speeders. Some sources claim that such systems are being implemented, with cameras taking photos of vehicles and recording exact times at entry and exit points, and issuing fines for speeding. However, other sources dispute this, stating that it is illegal and technically impossible to attach cameras to existing call box poles, and that the state's current traffic monitoring system is used for traffic flow and accident monitoring, not for law enforcement.", "141": "Reports of the red-bellied pacu, a fish with human-like teeth, biting off men's testicles and killing at least two victims, are disputed. Investigations found that the fish, identified as Pacu -LRB-Piaractus brachypomus-RRB-, is not aggressive towards humans and has a serious but not deadly bite. In one incident, a man was bitten in the private area and required medical attention, but no deaths were reported. The fish's diet consists of fruits, seeds, and nuts, and it has teeth that resemble human molars for crushing food, not ripping or biting off human body parts. The reports of two deaths may be false, and the fish's behavior is not consistent with the alleged attacks.", "267": "Christian Bale was initially set to play Steve Jobs in a biopic, but he has reportedly decided to quit the project due to conflicting feelings and doubts about his suitability for the role. The film's screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, had high hopes for Bale, believing he was the best fit for the part. However, Bale's exit leaves a void in the lead role, and potential replacements have not been named. The film's director, Danny Boyle, is meeting with actors to find a new Steve Jobs, with Seth Rogen reportedly in talks to play Steve Wozniak. The film's production has been plagued by delays and setbacks, including a pay dispute that led to the departure of the original director, David Fincher.", "184": "Several celebrities made statements about leaving the USA if George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election. Alec Baldwin denied making a statement to leave the country, but his wife Kim Basinger reportedly said he would flee if Bush won. Film director Robert Altman initially stated he would move to France if Bush was elected, but later claimed he meant to say he would move to Paris, Texas. Altman also expressed opposition to Bush's policies. However, Altman's statement was caught on film, contradicting his later denial. Despite the controversy, Baldwin insisted he never made the statement and would instead work to get Bush out of office in 2004.", "112": "A public service announcement in Lima, Peru, created by Everlast, showcases a humorous yet impactful approach to addressing street harassment. The video features men who catcall women on the street, only to be shocked when they realize the women are actually their own mothers. The mothers, disguised and made up, confront their sons, highlighting the severity of their actions. The video aims to raise awareness that 7 out of 10 women in Lima experience street harassment. The creative approach effectively conveys the message that catcalling is unacceptable, and the video's humor stems from the unexpected twist of sons catcalling their own mothers, making the issue more relatable and memorable.", "354": "Christian Bale was initially set to play Steve Jobs in a biopic, with director Danny Boyle and writer Aaron Sorkin on board. However, he later withdrew from the project, citing conflicting feelings and deciding he was not right for the part.

Despite this, the project continued with discussions of other actors, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper, potentially taking on the role.

Scalise denies attending the event, claiming he spoke at the conference by mistake, unaware of its true nature. However, a report from the event describes Scalise discussing ways to oversee mismanagement of tax revenue and criticizing a government program for racial bias, which suggests he was aware of the event's purpose.", "110": "Joan Rivers' doctor, Gwen Korovin, is denying that she took a selfie with Rivers while she was under anesthesia during a procedure. However, clinic workers reported that Korovin took the photo and made a comment that Rivers would think it was funny, suggesting she was aware of the photo being taken. Korovin's lawyer claims she does not discuss her patients or their care, citing confidentiality laws. Meanwhile, sources close to the investigation confirm that Korovin took the photo and performed an unauthorized biopsy, which may have led to Rivers' cardiac arrest. Korovin denies performing the biopsy and taking the selfie.", "287": "A woman named Jasmine Tridevil claimed to have spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted to become less attractive to men, but her story is disputed.

She reportedly contacted over 50 doctors before finding one willing to perform the surgery, and had a confidentiality agreement in place to protect the doctor's identity. However, evidence suggests that the surgery may be a hoax. A police report revealed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" was found in her stolen bag, and her social media posts were questioned for lacking any corroborating evidence. A business page attributed to her associate, Alisha Hessler, labeled her as a \"provider of internet hoaxes.", "218": "Tyson Foods has not dropped Labor Day as a holiday in favor of Eid al-Fitr. In 2008, a labor union at the company's Shelbyville, Tennessee, plant briefly removed Labor Day as a paid holiday and replaced it with Eid al-Fitr, but the company negotiated with the union to reinstate Labor Day. Labor Day remains a paid holiday at all of the company's U.S. plants, except for the Shelbyville plant, where Eid al-Fitr is one of the eight paid holidays.

In reality, he was using his phone as an IFB (interruptible feedback) to get cues from the control room, which lost signal, causing him to frantically dial the phone while his back was turned to the camera. He was not relieving himself, contrary to initial social media claims. NBC News anchor Brian Williams cleared Seidel's name, stating that the meteorologist was the victim of misinformation. Seidel's actions were misinterpreted as him zipping up his pants or urinating, but he was simply trying to resolve the communication issue.", "223": "Neil Armstrong, the Apollo 11 commander, initially stated that he misspoke when saying \"one small step for man\" instead of \"one small step for a man.\" However, the official transcript and recordings of the event do not support his claim.

A commemorative recording of the event also failed to capture the missing \"a.\" Armstrong's own recollections and a book he wrote later in life also contradict his initial claim.", "97": "Joan Rivers underwent an endoscopy at Yorkville Endoscopy, but the procedure took a turn for the worse. A biopsy was performed on her vocal cords without her consent, allegedly by her ear, nose, and throat doctor, Gwen Korovin. The doctor took a selfie with Rivers while she was under anesthesia, which is a major violation of her privacy. Rivers stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest, and she died a week later. Korovin denies taking the selfie and performing the unauthorized biopsy, but multiple sources contradict her claims, stating that the biopsy was performed and the selfie was taken before Rivers' cardiac arrest.", "204": "Several media outlets initially reported that a photo of Bernie Sanders from the civil rights era was not legitimate, claiming it was actually Bruce Rappaport. However, evidence contradicts this claim. A photographer who took the photo, Danny Lyon, revealed that he had \"newly discovered\" pictures from the same roll of film, confirming that the man in the photo is indeed Bernie Sanders. Additionally, a senatorial biographical video on Sanders' campaign website and a 2013 video show the same photo, with Sanders himself describing the event and the photo. This evidence supports the legitimacy of the photo and challenges the initial reports of its inauthenticity.", "165": "Centerville Elementary School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, canceled the Christmas play \"A Christmas Carol\" due to the amount of instructional time it required, not because of complaints about a reference to God. The school's decision was based on the fact that the play took up roughly 20 hours of instructional time, which is equivalent to one month of math instruction. The school's principal stated that they wanted to be respectful of the diverse cultural and religious backgrounds of their students, but this was not the reason for canceling the play. In fact, a Jewish family was wrongly blamed for the cancellation and was even accused of fleeing the area due to the alleged controversy.", "239": "Christian Bale was initially in final talks to play Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, but reportedly decided to pass on the part due to conflicting feelings and a conclusion that he was not the right person for the role. However, this claim was later disputed as Bale was confirmed to be starring as Steve Jobs in the biopic, with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin expressing confidence in his abilities and stating that he didn't need to audition. Ultimately, Bale dropped out of the project, making him the second high-profile actor to exit the film after Leonardo DiCaprio.", "167": "There is conflicting evidence regarding the claim that an eyeball-licking fad has produced a widespread outbreak of ocular maladies among Japanese schoolchildren. Some sources suggest that this practice, known as oculolinctus, may be causing a rise in cases of conjunctivitis and eye chlamydia, with one teacher reporting that one-third of his students admitted to engaging in the behavior.

Groucho then responded, \"I love my cigar too, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while.\" The studio audience laughed, but the exchange was deemed too racy for 1947 sensibilities and was deleted before airing.

The vaccine is not a ruse to sterilize women of childbearing age, as its primary goal is to prevent tetanus infection in newborns through maternal vaccination. The vaccine's effectiveness is demonstrated by its ability to provide protection to women and their unborn children, with the mother passing the protection to the baby in the womb. Laboratory tests have consistently shown that the vaccine does not contain human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that would be required to induce sterility.", "203": "The FDA has taken actions against CBD oil sales, citing regulatory violations and impermissible health claims. The agency claims that CBD products are \"adulterated\" and are being marketed as drugs, despite being labeled as dietary supplements. The FDA has sent warning letters to several companies, stating that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition due to ongoing drug investigations. However, critics argue that the FDA's actions are driven by a desire to hand over the market to pharmaceutical companies, effectively giving them a monopoly over CBD products. This has led to a debate over the FDA's true motives for regulating CBD oil.", "145": "The claim that animals are fleeing Yellowstone Park as an indicator of an imminent supervolcano eruption is not supported by evidence.  While some animals have indeed left the park, this is likely due to the depth of winter and the search for food, as they tend to migrate to lower elevations for sustenance. In fact, a video footage showed bison running for the joy of spring, with no indication of danger. Scientists also emphasize that the recent animal exodus is not a sign of an impending eruption, as the park's geologic activity has remained relatively constant since monitoring began 30 years ago, and another caldera-forming eruption is unlikely to occur in the next thousand or 10,000 years.", "183": "An academic study claimed that Hillary Clinton received more than 800,000 non-citizen votes in the 2016 presidential election. However, this claim is disputed by experts. Extrapolations based on a previous study estimated that 6.4% of non-citizens voted, with 81.8% voting for Clinton and 17.5% for Trump. This would add only 834,318 votes to Clinton's popular vote margin, which is less than a third of her total margin. Another study found that 6.4% of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2% in 2010, with non-citizens favoring Democrats. However, a critique of the study found it to be \"irresponsible social science\" with no evidence of non-citizens voting in recent U.S. elections.", "116": "Apple initially faced rumors that it would shut down Beats Music, a streaming service it acquired for $3 billion in May.

He reported a red trail on his abdomen, a burning sensation, and a scar that began to ooze. Doctors initially diagnosed him with an insect bite, but later confirmed the presence of a match-head-sized spider inside his skin. However, some arachnid experts have expressed skepticism about the claim, stating that it is \"not plausible\" and defies the biology of spiders, suggesting that the incident could have been caused by a different organism or be a complete fake.", "249": "Several experts have cast doubt on the story of Dylan Thomas, a 21-year-old man who claimed a spider burrowed through his surgery scar and lived under his skin for three days. Experts say it is not plausible for a spider to crawl beneath skin through a scar, and the claim defies logic and biology. They suggest that another organism, such as a tick or mite, could be responsible for the symptoms, but a spider is highly unlikely. The lack of evidence, including the spider itself, also raises suspicions. The experts' skepticism has raised questions about the accuracy of Thomas's account.", "226": "The federal government provides a one-time start-up payment to refugees, which can be up to $1,095, to cover basic needs like food, furniture, and clothing. Refugees also receive a temporary monthly allowance for food and shelter, which is based on provincial social assistance rates and typically around $592 per month. This support is temporary and lasts for one year or until they find a job. In contrast, Canadian pensioners receive a monthly maximum of $1,012 in old age pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement, which is a lifetime benefit.

The strike, which targeted Godane and other high-ranking officials, used manned aircraft and drones to destroy an encampment and a vehicle. Godane was considered one of the world's most wanted men, with a $7 million reward on his head for his capture. His death is seen as a significant blow to the group, and the US has vowed to continue pursuing the organization.", "91": "Argentina's President Christina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner adopted a 13-year-old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, but the motivations behind the adoption have been misinterpreted. The tradition of adopting the seventh child, which dates back to 1907, was initially aimed at preventing families from abandoning or killing their seventh sons due to a widespread fear of a local myth, \"el lobison,\" which states that the seventh son will turn into a werewolf-like creature. However, the adoption is not a literal attempt to prevent werewolfism, but rather a symbolic gesture to provide the child with a better life, including a gold medal and educational scholarship.", "370": "A Florida woman, Jasmine Tridevil, claimed to have undergone surgery to get a third breast, spending $20,000 on the procedure. However, her story was met with skepticism, and evidence suggests that she may have fabricated the claim. A police report from Tampa International Airport revealed that Tridevil reported her baggage stolen, and upon recovery, a property receipt listed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" valued at $5,000 inside her bag. Additionally, a business page attributed to Tridevil's real name, Alisha Hessler, described her as a \"provider of internet hoaxes\" since 2014. A top plastic surgeon also questioned the authenticity of the surgery, stating that no reasonable doctor would perform such an operation.", "298": "Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner adopted a young Jewish man, Yair Tawil, as her godson, sparking a claim that she did so to prevent him from turning into a werewolf-like creature, known as \"el lobiz\u00f3n,\" according to Argentine folklore. However, this claim is largely an urban myth with no basis in fact. The tradition of adopting seventh children, including those from Jewish families, is a real practice that originated in 1907 to demystify the folklore and prevent child abuse. The adoption provides the child with a gold medal, a scholarship, and presidential protection, but not to prevent a werewolf curse.", "303": "Argentina's president adopted a Jewish boy, Yair Tawil, as her godson, sparking claims that she did so to counteract a werewolf legend. According to folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf-like creature, \"el lobison,\" on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday, feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead. However, the tradition of presidential adoption dates back to 1907, when it was established as a response to the murder and abandonment of seventh children, not specifically to counteract the werewolf legend. The adoption provides the child with a gold medal and educational scholarship.", "58": "The claim that a meteor left a 40-foot crater near Managua's airport is disputed among experts. Initial reports suggested a meteorite broke off from a larger asteroid and created a crater, but NASA officials have raised doubts due to the lack of eyewitness accounts of a fireball in the sky. They estimate the energy required to create the crater would have generated a bright fireball visible over a wide area, but none was reported. Scientists also point out that no meteorite fragments have been found, and the crater's characteristics do not match typical meteorite impacts.", "39": "The claim that a rare meteorite impact caused a blast in Nicaragua's capital, Managua, is disputed among experts. While the Nicaraguan government initially confirmed a meteorite impact, creating a 40-foot-wide crater, NASA officials and astronomers raised doubts, citing the lack of eyewitness accounts of a fireball or debris trail. They estimated that a meteorite would have generated a bright fireball visible over a wide area, but none was reported. The energy needed to create the crater would be equivalent to a single ton of dynamite, and no meteorite fragments have been found.", "342": "Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adopted a Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, but not to save him from becoming a werewolf. The claim is a misconception based on an urban legend that seventh sons in Argentina are destined to turn into a creature called \"el lobison\" or werewolf, which was believed to feed on unbaptized babies and spread its curse by biting. The tradition of the President adopting seventh children began in 1907 as a response to the murder and abandonment of these children, but it was not to prevent them from turning into werewolves.", "28": "Microsoft has introduced a fleet of robotic security guards, known as K5, to watch for trouble on its Silicon Valley campus. The 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots are equipped with cameras, sensors, and artificial intelligence to monitor and patrol the area. They can detect suspicious activity, sound alarms, and call human security guards if necessary. The robots can also read license plates, analyze faces, and track weather conditions. While they do not have weapons, there are plans to equip them with tasers in the future. The robots can operate for 24 hours on a single charge and return to a charging station to recharge.", "132": "Microsoft has hired robot security guards to protect its Silicon Valley campus.

However, historians debunk this claim, stating that the tradition of the president adopting the seventh child in a family has no connection to the werewolf legend. The custom began in 1907 as a response to families abandoning or murdering their seventh sons, not to prevent them from becoming werewolves. The seventh child in a family is eligible for adoption as the president's godchild, regardless of the family's faith, and receives a gold medal and educational scholarship."}
