Meanwhile, Marie Yovanovitch, a former ambassador to Ukraine, responded to GOP claims that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election and said the military aid Trump endorsed has benefited Ukraine in its war against Russia.", "healthcare_394": "President Obama on Monday defended the Affordable Care Act and the problems that have plagued the central website launched earlier this month to sign up consumers, and appealed to the public to have patience as the site is being fixed. Obama stood front-and-center in the White House Rose Garden and said he would not excuse the problems with the site, but said consumers can apply by mail or phone. Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services on Sunday posted a blog on its site with some preliminary statistics and an assurance to Americans that officials are working around the clock to address the glitches. The president told his team the administration had to own up to the fact that there were no excuses for not having the health care website ready to operate on Day One.", "terrorism_253": "Terror attacks in Brussels, Belgium killed 31 people and injured 300 others. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks. Belgian federal prosecutors identified two of the attackers as brothers Khalid and Ibrahim El Bakraoui. They were involved in one of the airport attacks and the subway blast. Belgian authorities are actively hunting for the third suspect in the airport attack. The third suspect is believed to have planted the bomb at the airport and then left. The attack has left Belgium on high alert, with additional police and military patrols in place. Belgian authorities have also arrested several suspects in raids across the country.", "healthcare_479": "President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan faced a crushing defeat Friday as Republicans abandoned their effort to replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump had personally lobbied House members in an effort to win over the holdouts, but ultimately, he was unable to secure the necessary votes. The failure of the vote was a major setback for Trump, as it marked the first major legislative defeat of his presidency. Despite the setback, Trump and Ryan are not giving up on their goal of repealing the ACA, but they are shifting their focus to other issues, such as tax reform.", "elections_54": "In New York, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton scored significant victories in Tuesday's primaries. Trump received a majority of the vote statewide and is likely to win most of the remaining delegates, which would put him close to the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination. Cruz and Sanders are struggling to keep up and may have to rely on superdelegates to win. The outcome was seen as a blow to Cruz and Sanders, who both face tough re-election challenges in November. However, the victory also gave Trump a boost of momentum and confidence, and he vowed to continue his campaign with renewed vigor.", "elections_133": "Roy Moore won the Republican Senate primary runoff in Alabama against Luther Strange, who was backed by Donald Trump. This was a blow to the GOP establishment, as Trump had initially supported Strange. The election was seen as a test of Trump's influence and his ability to rally his supporters. The outcome was not surprising, as Trump had been unpopular in Alabama before the election. The election also highlighted the deep divide within the Republican Party, as Strange was seen as more moderate than Moore.", "supreme_court_232": "President Trump is set to announce his pick for the Supreme Court Monday night, potentially setting the direction of the court for decades and sparking an acrimonious political battle. The four finalists are Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, Amy Coney Barrett, and Thomas Hardiman. Kavanaugh is the most conservative of the four and has been a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, religious freedom, and the right to bear arms. If confirmed, Kavanaugh would replace Anthony Kennedy, who was the swing vote on many of the court's most ideologically charged decisions, including Roe v. Wade.", "north_korea_483": "In a major diplomatic breakthrough, President Donald Trump has agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time. The meeting is set to take place in two months and will focus on the North\u2019s nuclear program. The announcement was made by South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong after a visit to Pyongyang earlier this week. Kim reportedly expressed a desire for mutual denuclearization and normalized relations with the US. While some have expressed skepticism about the meeting, others see it as a positive step towards resolving the longstanding conflict on the Korean peninsula.", "violence_in_america_208": "Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday for murder after she shot and killed her unarmed black neighbor Botham Jean in September 2018. Amber Guyger was off-duty but still in uniform the night she killed Jean at the South Side Flats apartments just blocks from police headquarters. She said she mistook his apartment for hers and thought he was a burglar. After a day of testimony focused on how long Guyger would spend in prison, Jean\u2019s 18-year-old brother said in his victim-impact statement that he wished she did not have to serve any time at all. Instead, he said, he wanted for Guyger what his older brother would have wanted.

During her time in power, Thatcher emphasized moral absolutism, nationalism, and the rights of the individual versus the state, famously declaring \"There is no such thing as society\" in 1987. She also presided over a period of economic and social transformation, privatizing the state sector and implementing policies that reduced unemployment. Thatcher's legacy remains highly controversial, with some revering her as a savior who rescued Britain from ruin and laid the groundwork for an extraordinary economic renaissance, while others criticize her for her hardline approach, which they say ushered in an era of greed and inequality.", "elections_739": "In the 2016 presidential race, the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has been criticized for his refusal to say whether he believes President Barack Obama was born in the United States. At a campaign event on Friday, Trump finally conceded that Obama was born in the U.S., but he also accused Hillary Clinton of raising questions about Obama's citizenship during the 2008 campaign. This admission comes after Trump's aides and allies have been pressuring him to disavow the theories that fueled his political rise. Despite this, Trump has continued to play coy about the issue, often saying in interviews that the issue doesn't matter anymore. The shift in Trump's stance comes after Kellyanne Conway, a respected GOP pollster, was installed as his campaign manager in a leadership shakeup last month. While Trump has had lapses, he has generally been more restrained, even taking a pass on health conspiracy theories after Clinton nearly collapsed following a pneumonia diagnosis.", "elections_93": "Sen. Ted Cruz announced on Monday that he is running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, making him the first major candidate to officially toss his hat in the ring. While the election is still a long way off, there are several compelling reasons why Cruz should be considered a strong GOP presidential candidate for 2016. Cruz is off to an early start, has strong Tea Party support, has been one of the party's most outspoken opponents of Obamacare, has a strong legal background, and could appeal to disillusioned voters. He is also seen as more independent than other potential GOP candidates, as shown by his defiance of party leaders on immigration.", "impeachment_370": "The U.S. Senate on Wednesday began the presidential impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republicans quickly abandoning their plans to cram opening arguments into two days.

Trump and vice-president-elect Mike Pence were huddled at Trump Tower in New York to work on key appointments as the US Senate was due to resume business in a still shellshocked Washington. The departure of former Republican congressman Mike Rogers from the president-elect\u2019s transition team offered the latest clue that the transition is going to be every bit as bumpy as feared. A week after his election, Trump and vice-president-elect Mike Pence were huddled at Trump Tower in New York to work on key appointments as the US Senate was due to resume business in a still shellshocked Washington.

A number of signs, including the endorsement of former vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, suggest that many Republican leaders are viewing Trump as less of an existential threat than his rival, Ted Cruz. Palin, who has spoken openly about her anger with the press and Republican Party leaders, appeared to recognize that her endorsement marked a moment of comeback.

About 5 percent of Americans have plans through the individual insurance market, and as many as two-thirds of them could lose coverage because it doesn\u2019t comply with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s standards.

The first month of enrollment through the federal HealthCare.gov site resulted in only 106,185 sign-ups, far below the administration\u2019s initial hopes and estimates. In addition to the low sign-ups, the website has been plagued with technical problems that have prevented many consumers from completing the enrollment process. The Obama administration is scrambling to fix the problems and hopes to have the site running smoothly for most people by the end of the month. Meanwhile, Republicans continue their attacks on the ACA, arguing that the enrollment figures demonstrate the law\u2019s failure and calling for its repeal.", "violence_in_america_747": "The Navy Yard shooting has raised questions about the security clearance system used by the military and contractors.

The decision means the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will continue to review the case, which could ease some pressure on Congress to quickly come up with a legislative solution. The fight over DACA, which provides protections to undocumented immigrants en masse, has been ongoing since 2012. Trump has set March 5 as the end date for the program, while calling on Congress to come up with a legislative fix.
