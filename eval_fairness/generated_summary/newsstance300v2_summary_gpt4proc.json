Despite facing dangerous situations such as ambushes and direct confrontations with enemy combatants, Kerry demonstrated leadership by making tactical decisions that ensured the safety of his crew and the success of their missions. His actions, such as beaching his boat under fire to engage a guerrilla carrying a rocket launcher, were recognized with a Silver Star and Purple Hearts, the awarding of which were backed by his commanding officers who praised his courage and decision-making under fire.

To counteract the fears and stigma from this folklore, which led to family abandonments and even murders, Argentinian presidents have been adopting seventh sons since 1907, a practice formalized in 1973. This custom, previously for only Catholic children, was extended to include Jewish children in 2009. Yair became the first Jewish child to participate in this tradition, reflecting a broader inclusion and debunking of the myth as families previously feared the werewolf curse, sparking the original adoption practice. Historically, the adoption was meant more to provide protection and stigmatize superstitions rather than any real belief in the folklore.", "289": "The campaign by Everlast, titled \"Harassing Your Mother,\" involves a social experiment where men in Lima, Peru, unknowingly catcall their own mothers disguised by makeovers.

This custom, which started at the beginning of the 20th century to protect such children from abandonment or worse, initially applied only to Catholic families. It was extended to children of other faiths in 2009 by presidential decree. Thus, the adoption of Yair Tawil, the seventh son of a Jewish family, by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, while historically significant as the first for a Jewish child, was part of this broader traditional practice and was not specifically to prevent him from becoming a werewolf, as such fears were not centrally related to his adoption.", "143": "Several reports have surfaced about the controversial production of cheap soy sauce in China involving unconventional ingredients.

Yair Tawil became the first Jewish child to be adopted under this tradition. The werewolf myth, which involves the seventh son turning into a creature called \"el lobison,\" is unrelated to the presidential adoption and has no actual ties to the ceremonial practices involving the president.

She stated that her motivation was to become unattractive to men and potentially secure a reality TV show. However, substantial skepticism surrounds her claim. Critics and investigations, including a Snopes review and a TMZ report, suggest the third breast might be a hoax. A police report revealed the recovery of a \"3 breast prosthesis\" from a stolen bag, suggesting the third breast could be fake.

One tradition allows every seventh son to become the president's godchild to protect them from a superstitious stigma, offering a medal and educational scholarships. This has been in practice since 1907 and was opened to all religions in 2009. The other, unrelated, superstition involves the belief that the seventh son turns into a werewolf, known as \"El Lobison,\" which has historically led to fear and violence. The confusion appeared to arise from the conflation of these two customs by the media. Yair Tawil's adoption by President Kirchner as her godson was part of the former tradition and had nothing to do with preventing a transformation into a werewolf.", "180": "There is conflicting information regarding the claim that gang initiates are bumping into cars and then shooting the drivers who get out. In Buffalo, the Police Commissioner reported an incident and issued a public alert based on credible evidence of such gang activities, specifically citing an instance where a driver was shot after being signaled to pull over by alleged gang members. However, in Fayetteville and Tallahassee, similar rumors about gang initiations involving car accidents were investigated by the police and dismissed as urban legends, with officials finding no substantial evidence to support the claims circulating via text messages and emails.", "326": "Argentina's President Christina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner adopted Yair Tawil, a Jewish man, as her godson, marking the first time a Jewish child has been adopted in this capacity by an Argentine president. This event is part of a century-old tradition aimed at dispelling the stigma surrounding the legend that the seventh son in a family would turn into a werewolf, a belief that prompted the enactment of a law ensuring presidential adoption for such children, initially only applying to Catholics. The inclusion of children from other religions was made possible by a presidential decree in 2009. The adoption involved a ceremonial meeting, including the lighting of Hanukkah candles, symbolically ending the alleged curse and granting Tawil a gold medal and an educational scholarship until he turns 21.", "65": "A viral video created by YouTuber Josh Paler Lin captured him giving $100 to a homeless man named Thomas, who was then secretly filmed spending the money on food for others rather than alcohol, contrary to Lin's expectations. The video, which showed Thomas's generosity, went viral, leading to over $130,000 in donations to help him. However, an eyewitness named Taugan Tan Kadalim claimed that the video was staged, alleging that Lin drove Thomas to the liquor store and orchestrated the whole scene, casting doubt on the authenticity of the events depicted in the video. Lin has denied these allegations, insisting that the video was genuine and not scripted.", "1": "Despite the Nigerian government announcing a ceasefire with Boko Haram, violence has continued unabated in Borno state. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has publicly denied any truce with the government, asserting that the kidnapped schoolgirls have been married off and converting them to Islam. Recent attacks by the group on Nigerian soldiers and civilians have signified ongoing hostilities. There is skepticism about the effectiveness of the ceasefire, as not all Boko Haram fighters seem aware or in agreement with the truce, and the government may have negotiated with only a faction of the group. This scenario has led to doubts about the credibility of the ceasefire claims, with violent incidents and statements by the Boko Hadam leader directly contradicting the government's announcements.", "228": "Christian Bale has decided to withdraw from playing Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, despite being in final talks for the role. His exit follows a period of deliberation and a realization that he was not the right fit for the character. This decision leaves the production searching for a replacement, with actors such as Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper previously mentioned as possible contenders. Bale\u2019s departure is confirmed by multiple reports citing issues of self-doubt about his suitability for the role. This marks the second high-profile withdrawal from the project, following Leonardo DiCaprio's earlier decision to pass on the role.", "301": "Argentine Presidents traditionally adopt the seventh son of a family to counteract an old folklore belief that such boys are destined to become werewolves, known as \"el lobison.\" This practice, enacted through a law from the 1920s and later expanded in 2009 to include non-Catholic and female children, aims to prevent the stigma that often led families to abandon, adopt out, or even kill their seventh sons. Recipients of this adoption receive presidential protection, a medal, and a scholarship until age 21. This tradition underscores a symbolic act blending cultural beliefs with state-supported inclusivity, rather than literal belief in werewolves.", "79": "The widespread story that a New York teenager, Mohammed Islam, made $72 million trading stocks has been debunked by multiple sources including himself. Islam admitted in various interviews that the renowned figure of $72 million was inaccurate and that his actual earnings from trading were significantly lower, closer to a few million dollars. Despite initial reports and a swell of media hype claiming his net worth was in the high eight figures, the real source of his wealth remains unclear, with speculations about potential inheritance. Critiques have emerged suggesting that the sensationalism in reporting overshadowed the facts, casting doubts on the depiction of so-called teenage financial dominance worldwide.", "147": "Multiple experts from ornithology and rice industry backgrounds refute the claim that uncooked rice thrown at weddings kills birds by expanding in their stomachs. Authorities from Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, the USA Rice Federation, University of California at Berkeley, and members of the Connecticut Audubon Society all agree that this is a myth, emphasizing that birds can safely ingest uncooked rice without harm. Expert opinions highlight that rice, even when uncooked, does not pose a digestive risk to birds, and that such concerns are unfounded, continuing a traditional wedding practice without causing harm to wildlife.", "303": "Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner adopted Yair Tawil, a young Jewish man, as part of a century-old tradition aimed at countering a folklore about the \"lobison,\" a werewolf creature said to emerge from the seventh son in a family. This presidential practice, initially established to prevent the murder or abandonment of such children due to fear of the curse, was decreed in 1973 to include daughters and later amended to include non-Catholics in 2009. While some sources suggest the adoption is a direct response to the feared transformation, others clarify that it is largely symbolic, aiming to preserve a custom and protect children from historical stigmas associated with the myth rather than believing in the literal existence of werewolves.", "224": "Despite claims that President Obama tried to hinder the mission to kill Osama bin Laden and took undue credit, evidence largely contradicts this. Admiral Bill McRaven and other key figures praised Obama\u2019s decisive leadership and credited him with making the critical decision to go ahead with the raid. President Obama himself acknowledged and thanked the intelligence and Special Forces teams in public speeches, highlighting their heroism and professionalism. Moreover, Obama personally met with and thanked the Navy SEALs involved, awarding them the Presidential Unit Citation, thus recognizing their roles explicitly in the successful operation. Claims of Obama attempting to stop the mission and taking sole credit do not align with documented affirmations of his involvement and the credit he attributed to others.", "7": "An Australian man, Dylan Thomas, experienced a horrifying incident where a spider burrowed into his abdomen through his appendix scar while he was vacationing in Bali. The spider, which was later extracted by doctors, caused a red trail and blistering over Thomas's skin. Despite initial misdiagnoses as an insect bite, medical tests confirmed the presence of the spider, significantly impacting Thomas emotionally. However, skepticism arises from scientific experts who question the plausibility of a spider burrowing through scar tissue, suggesting that the incident might be exaggerated or misunderstood, as spiders do not typically burrow into human skin.", "165": "The claim that Centerville Elementary School canceled its Christmas play due to complaints from two parents about a religious reference is incorrect. The school administration clarified that the play was canceled due to the significant amount of classroom time it consumed, which was becoming a concern for instructional priorities. The decision was purely based on educational considerations and not on any religious complaints. Investigations and statements from organizations such as the Anti Defamation League and principal Tom Kramer confirmed that the cancellation was not influenced by any parental complaints regarding religious content. Additionally, alternatives such as after-school rehearsals were considered but not pursued. The rumor of a Jewish family influencing the decision was also debunked, as they were merely on a pre-planned vacation.", "279": "Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adopted Yair Tawil as her godson, a tradition granting a presidential godchild status to the seventh son or daughter, providing them with a medal and educational scholarship until age 21. This custom is traced back to Russian immigrants and was legislated in the 1970s, originally for Catholic families but extended in 2009 to include children of all faiths.

Invertebrate experts and internet hoax debunkers agree that the image, which features a large crab-like shape in the harbor of Whitstable, is likely edited, noting that no species of crab grows nearly that large, with the largest known crab species, the Japanese spider crab, reaching only about 12 feet in span. The person behind the photograph, Quinton Winter, has admitted to recognizing the image's potential for attention but insists it was meant as light-hearted fun. Consequently, credible evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the photograph does not depict a real giant crab.", "83": "Reports circulating on social media and various websites claimed that the small town of Purdon, Texas was quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus.

Contrary to Lin's expectations, Thomas used the money to buy food, which he shared with other homeless people instead of spending it on himself. This act of generosity was captured in a video that gathered significant attention and led to a crowdfunding campaign raising a substantial amount of money to help Thomas. However, there have been allegations suggesting that the video might have been staged, with claims that Thomas knew he was being filmed. Despite these concerns, the video has positively impacted views on homelessness and raised funds for the cause.", "81": "Reports have circulated suggesting KFC plans to introduce marijuana sales in its Colorado stores. However, this sensational claim lacks credibility and confirmation from reliable sources. The originating article from the Racket Report, a site known for satirical content, and lack of official announcements from KFC hint at a hoax. Multiple sources debunk this claim, noting the legal ambiguities and operational challenges such a move would entail for KFC, further evidenced by the absence of any related updates on KFC's official news platforms.

However, multiple sources suggest the third breast is likely a hoax. An airport incident report revealed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" listed among retrieved stolen luggage items, strongly indicating the third breast is artificial. Additionally, Snopes and other investigative reports have cast doubt on the authenticity of her claims, with evidence pointing towards the third breast being a fabricated story to gain viral attention and possibly secure a reality TV show. Despite Tridevil's insistence on having undertaken the procedure, including her statements about the challenges of finding a compliant doctor and the significant personal and financial costs involved, the preponderance of evidence supports the conclusion that the third breast is not real.", "141": "Investigations and statements from scientific and local sources largely refute the claim that the red-bellied pacu, related to the piranha, has bitten off men's testicles and caused fatalities. While there have been some incidents involving the pacu biting humans, including a case where an individual required medical attention for a bite to the private parts, these instances are rare and no credible reports confirm deaths specifically due to pacu attacks.

They also noted inconsistencies in the event's timing relative to known asteroid trajectories. The lack of eyewitness reports of a visible fireball, despite the dense population, further fueled doubts about the meteorite hypothesis.", "87": "Reports and rumors suggest that Saudia, Saudi Arabia's national airline, is considering implementing gender segregation on its flights following complaints about seating arrangements. Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, an assistant marketing manager for the airline, has been frequently quoted stating that measures to address these complaints will be enacted soon, including potential segregation unless passengers are closely related. However, Al Fahad has disputed some reports, claiming his comments were taken out of context or fabricated, particularly in regard to specific plans for onboard separation. The planned policy aligns with the conservative practices in Saudi Arabia, which adhere closely to Islamic guidelines, impacting societal norms and regulations.", "310": "A PSA by Everlast filmed in Lima, Peru, showcases a staged encounter where men catcall women who turn out to be their own mothers in disguise. This shock tactic, aimed at highlighting the prevalence of street harassment, involves mothers confronting their sons after being subjected to derogatory comments, leading to expressions of shame and horror from the men. While the setup is artificial, the message is potent, emphasizing the disgusting nature of catcalling by having men inadvertently harass their mothers. The video serves as a vivid reminder to street harassers to see women as individuals deserving of respect. This approach not only went viral but also sparked discussions on the impact of street harassment and the potential psychological effects of realizing that one's target of lewd comments could be a family member.", "271": "A large crater found near Managua's airport, reportedly caused by a meteorite, is debated among experts.

They cite seismic readings and onsite evidence aligning with a meteorite impact. Despite this assertion, the lack of eyewitness fireball reports and undiscovered meteorite fragments continue to fuel doubts about the crater's origin.", "300": "The claim that Argentine presidents routinely adopt potential werewolves is rooted in a blending of historical tradition and urban legend. Since 1907, Argentine presidents have adopted the seventh son or daughter of a family, a practice prompted by an old Russian custom and aimed at preventing societal stigma, not to explicitly prevent children from becoming werewolves as per legend. The myth of the \"lobiz\u00f3n,\" or werewolf, which claims the seventh son transforms into a beast, is not officially linked to this presidential godparent tradition. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s adoption of a Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil, was significant for its inclusivity, representing the first non-Christian to be adopted, not necessarily due to fears of him becoming a werewolf.

Subsequent reports confirmed his departure, noting the continued search for a suitable actor to play Jobs as Bale and other potential candidates, including Leonardo DiCaprio, had all passed on the role.

Additionally, while thieves do misuse hotel keycards, they are primarily repurposed for storing stolen credit card data acquired through other means, not because the keycards originally contained personal information.", "286": "The tale of Argentina's President adopting a Jewish boy, Yair Tawil, to prevent his transformation into a werewolf is based on a mix of truth and folklore. While a longstanding tradition allows the President to adopt the seventh child of a family to provide blessings including education and a medal, this became entangled with the myth of the \"lobison,\" a werewolf-like creature. However, experts clarify that the werewolf narrative is merely an exciting spin on an unrelated, century-old custom, and the President's adoption practice does not actually relate to preventing a curse. Despite media reports suggesting otherwise, the President's recent adoption was in line with the traditional gesture, not to deter any mythical transformation.", "153": "Luxottica, a major entity in the eyewear industry, is often portrayed as holding a significant market share, with claims of controlling 80% of eyewear brands and several major optometry chains, including LensCrafters and Pearle Vision. It also owns the EyeMed Vision Care insurance group. However, contrasting reports suggest that Luxottica produced less than 10% of the global frames and owns around 30 eyewear brands, disputing the monopoly-like dominance. Moreover, federal oversight bodies like the FTC have not classified Luxottica's market activities as a monopoly, noting it controls about 20% of the U.S. retail market, which challenges the claim of overarching control.", "305": "The claim that Argentina's president adopted a Jewish godson to prevent him from becoming a werewolf is a blending of an unrelated tradition and a local myth. Historically, the Argentine president adopts the seventh son or daughter of a family to provide a scholarship and a medal, a practice unrelated to preventing werewolf transformations, according to historian Daniel Balmaceda. The story that the adoption is meant to counteract the \"El Lobison\" werewolf legend, in which the seventh son turns into a werewolf, appears to be a sensational mix-up of cultural customs and folklore, with no official statement or confirmation tying the adoption directly to this superstition.", "357": "NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel was involved in a misunderstanding during a live broadcast where it appeared to some viewers that he might be relieving himself on camera. However, Brian Williams clarified that Seidel was actually experiencing technical difficulties with his cellphone communication with the studio. With his earpiece malfunctioning and unable to hear that he was on-air, Seidel turned his back to the camera to re-dial his phone, leading to misinterpretations by social media and rumors that he was writing his name in the snow. Williams asked for an apology on behalf of Seidel, explaining the situation and reaffirming Seidel's professionalism during the broadcast mishap.", "269": "Christian Bale was initially confirmed by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to play Steve Jobs in Danny Boyle's biopic, with Sorkin expressing confidence in Bale's abilities for a dialog-intensive role. However, multiple sources later reported that Bale decided to withdraw from the role after much deliberation and conflicting feelings about his suitability for the part. He concluded that he was not right for it. This decision left the project searching for another lead actor, despite earlier enthusiasm about Bale's involvement and casting announcements that positioned him as the ideal candidate without requiring an audition.", "90": "The controversial Peruvian public service announcement titled \"Harassing Your Mother\" depicted men street harassing women who turned out to be their own disguised mothers. While the content aimed to highlight and combat the seriousness of street harassment, multiple sources confirmed that the scenes were staged with actors, rather than capturing genuine reactions of unknowing sons. Although the depicted scenarios were scripted, the video was based on real stories of men who inadvertently harassed female relatives. The reactions shown in the video, including embarrassment and shock, were intended to provoke thought and discourage catcalling, yet the fact that these were not real incidents has sparked debate about the effectiveness and authenticity of such social experiments.", "107": "The concept of a fifty-foot crab dubbed 'Crabzilla' spotted in Kent, England, has been widely dismissed as a hoax by experts and online debunkers. The image, originally shared on Weird Whitstable, a site known for supernatural sightings, was identified by experts as a likely digitally manipulated photo of a shore crab, far smaller in reality. Prominent figures like Paul Clark from the Natural History Museum and Dr. Verity Nye from Southampton University have critically examined the image and dismissed it, noting the largest known crabs like the Japanese spider crab, which live in deep waters and are significantly smaller than the claimed 'Crabzilla.' Additionally, the original image used in the hoax lacks any real-life giant crab, undermining any credibility to the sightings reports.", "108": "Jasmine Tridevil, a Florida massage therapist, claimed to have undergone plastic surgery to implant a third breast, spending $20,000 and contacting numerous doctors to complete the procedure, ostensibly to become unattractive to men and pursue a reality TV career. However, credibility issues surface as a police report revealed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" was found in her stolen bag, hinting at a hoax. Further doubts are raised by allegations of her involvement in previous hoaxes under the name Alisha Hessler and expert opinions challenging the ethics and feasibility of such a surgery. These elements cast significant doubt on the authenticity of her claims.", "325": "President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner of Argentina adopted Yair Tawil, a Jewish boy, as her godson, marking him as the first Jewish child to be part of this tradition that dates back to 1907. Previously, this custom was only applicable to Catholic families until 2009 when it was extended to potentially any child irrespective of their religion. The tradition, rooted in Argentinian folklore about the seventh son becoming a werewolf, aims to protect these children from abandonment or harm. Yair\u2019s adoption received presidential honors, including a gold medal and a scholarship, aligning with the historical practice intended to provide security and benefits to the adopted child.", "182": "There are mixed opinions and findings about the effectiveness of swallowing active dry yeast to prevent drunkeness when consuming alcohol. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that consuming active dry yeast, as done by individuals like a renowned brewer, can possibly mitigate the effects of alcohol, exhibiting less intoxication despite considerable alcohol intake. However, scientific perspectives argue against its efficacy due to the unstable nature of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase at the acidic pH of the stomach, which possibly nullifies any potential beneficial effect of the yeast in alcohol metabolism. Furthermore, risks mentioned include the potential for yeast to produce alcohol or exacerbate hangover effects due to increased toxic byproducts. Thus, while there are personal testimonies supporting the use of yeast, scientific research primarily suggests its ineffectiveness and possible risks.", "0": "Dylan Thomas, a 21-year-old Australian tourist, reported a disturbing encounter in Bali where a spider allegedly burrowed through his appendix scar and traveled under his skin up to his sternum, causing severe discomfort and a visible red trail. Despite initial misdiagnoses as an insect bite and treatment with antihistamines, the spider was eventually removed by doctors in Bali, who extracted it using tweezers. However, some arachnid experts have expressed skepticism about the plausibility of such an incident, suggesting the story may be exaggerated or incorrect, as the behavior described is uncharacteristic of spiders and possibly implausible biologically.", "184": "During the 2000 presidential election, some celebrities did make statements about leaving the USA if George W. Bush were elected. Robert Altman explicitly stated at the Cannes film festival and while promoting his film in France that he would move to France if Bush won, citing a catastrophe for the world due to his proposed policies. Alec Baldwin was reported to have said he would leave the country, but he strongly denied ever making such a statement, attributing the confusion to potentially being mistaken for Altman. Baldwin's wife, Kim Basinger, was cited in a magazine suggesting Baldwin could leave, which Baldwin also disputed. This led to considerable media confusion and controversy, with Baldwin clarifying his intentions to stay and fight against the Bush administration rather than fleeing the country.", "39": "A loud boom and crater in Managua reportedly caused by a meteorite has raised skepticism among experts, including NASA, due to the absence of eyewitness accounts of a fireball, which should have been visible given the crater's size and the highly populated area. Some Nicaraguan officials and local scientists believe the crater resulted from a meteorite linked to asteroid 2014 RC, citing a coinciding seismic register and the characteristics of the crater. However, the inconsistency in eyewitness reports of a visible fireball and the lack of recovered meteorite fragments lead to doubts regarding the meteoritic origin of the event, with alternative causes considered more likely by several astronomers and NASA personnel who highlight the mismatch in timing between the asteroid's approach and the explosion.", "249": "Dylan Thomas, a 21-year-old from Bunbury, claimed a spider burrowed through his appendix scar and lived under his skin while he was vacationing in Bali. This story garnered viral attention after the spider was allegedly removed and Thomas shared his experience online. However, experts have expressed severe doubts regarding the accuracy of this account. Arachnologists like Christopher Buddle from McGill University and Dr. Charles Griswold from the California Academy of Sciences argue that the behavior described is implausible for spiders and unlike any known biology of spiders. They suggest it might have been another organism or even a fabricated story, as spiders do not crawl beneath skin or sustain themselves in such environments, and no physical evidence of the spider was conclusively presented.", "110": "Joan Rivers' ear, nose, and throat doctor, Gwen Korovin, who allegedly performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, has been accused by medical staff of taking a selfie with the sedated comedian. This claim has surfaced amid investigations following Rivers' death after the supposed procedure. Staff members reportedly heard Korovin make remarks suggesting Rivers would find the selfie amusing. However, Korovin categorically denies both the accusations of taking the selfie and performing any unauthorized procedure. The investigation into the matter is ongoing, and the controversy remains unresolved as clinic workers and Korovin's statements conflict.", "118": "Reports of a Bugatti Veyron being vandalized with a penis drawing in Seattle garnered mixed reactions online, with some viewers outraged and others amused. However, evidence suggests that this incident was actually a staged prank by YouTube content creators TwinzTV. Instagram user andreysmygov, associated with VG Productions, revealed that the graffiti was part of a setup for a video, and subsequent images showed the car with different markings. Despite initial appearances, this act of vandalism appears to have been a planned event for entertainment rather than a genuine act of public defacement.", "344": "The claim that Argentina's President adopted a Jewish child to prevent him from becoming a werewolf is a blend of myth and confusion between two unrelated traditions. While there is indeed a longstanding custom where the Argentine president adopts the seventh son or daughter of a family, which includes a medal and educational benefits, this practice stems from a historical move to protect children from a folkloric stigma where the seventh son was believed to turn into a werewolf. However, historians and reports clarify that the adoption tradition is not directly connected to preventing werewolf transformation. This confusion arose when President Cristina Kirchner adopted Yair Tawil, making him the first Jewish godson, aligning with a broader, inclusive decree from 2009 that expanded the custom beyond Catholic families. The actual ceremony coincided with Hanukkah, adding a cultural celebration rather than an act to prevent mythical transformation.", "253": "A Bunbury local, Dylan Thomas, reported an alarming incident during his Bali vacation where he claimed a tropical spider burrowed under his skin via an appendix scar and resided there for three days before being removed by medical professionals. The spider supposedly entered his body while he was sleeping and caused a painful, burning sensation along with a visible red trail up his abdomen. However, some arachnid experts have expressed skepticism about the occurrence, suggesting the scenario to be implausible for spiders and questioning the validity of the claim since typical spider behavior doesn't include burrowing under human skin. There is a possibility that another type of organism might be involved, if the event occurred at all.", "3": "The claim that RoboCop-style robots are patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus has been refuted by Knightscope co-founder Stacy Stephens, who clarified that the rumors originated from a demonstration event and that Microsoft does not currently have these K5 robots deployed on its campus.

Instead, Seidel was experiencing technical difficulties with his cellphone while trying to receive cues from NBC\u2019s control room during a snowstorm in North Carolina. He was adjusting his phone and securing his gloves, not aware he was on live air due to the communication issues. Multiple sources confirm this explanation, emphasizing that the appearance and subsequent social media reaction were based on misinformation. Some contrasting views humorously suggest Seidel was caught relieving himself, but these are unsubstantiated and contradicted by official statements and the context provided by credible news figures such as Williams.", "359": "YouTube star Josh Paler Lin conducted a social experiment by giving a homeless man named Thomas $100, then secretly filming his spending behavior. Contrary to expectations, Thomas used the money to buy food, which he distributed to other homeless individuals. While most accounts suggest Thomas was unaware of being filmed initially, an eyewitness claimed Thomas and Lin were seen together before filming, indicating potential prior knowledge of the video setup. This raises questions about the authenticity of the experiment, despite the positive impact seen in the substantial amount of donations collected to help Thomas.", "85": "A viral video sponsored by Everlast and produced in collaboration with activist group Paremos el Acoso Callejero purportedly captures chronic catcallers in Lima, Peru, unknowingly harassing their own mothers disguised by makeovers. Despite initial appearances suggesting a candid setup to teach the catcallers a lesson, multiple sources confirm that the scenarios were staged with actors, based on interviews with real subjects who experienced similar shame when unknowingly harassing female relatives. The campaign aimed to highlight the pervasive issue of street harassment by presenting a shocking twist, albeit in a scripted format, to draw attention and provoke discussion on respecting women.", "78": "Rumors about Lucita Sandoval, a supposed teacher from Santiago del Estero, making a sex tape with a 16-year-old student circulated widely, with sensational reports claiming the video showed her with the underage boy. However, investigations by local newspapers revealed that the story was largely a hoax. The woman in the video, misidentified as Sandoval, is actually from Corrientes and the male is a college student, not a teenager. The video did not involve a teacher and her pupil but was a private video that leaked online, leading to widespread misreporting and false accusations against a nonexistent teacher-student relationship.", "99": "The claim of a 50-foot \"Crabzilla\" lurking off the coast of Whitstable garnered significant attention after an image went viral online, appearing on a local site known for documenting unusual sightings. The image, which was perceived by some as a real giant crab, was acknowledged by the site's curator as a playful exhibition, hinting at it being a staged depiction rather than a genuine discovery. Skepticism arose with experts debunking the photograph as a simple Photoshop manipulation, noting the improbability of such a large crab existing, especially considering the known sizes and habitats of the largest crabs, like the Japanese spider crab. Furthermore, invertebrate specialists and graphic artists confirmed that the image was digitally altered, and it lacked credibility in the scientific community.", "50": "Several sources suggest that the penis graffiti on a $2.5 million Bugatti Veyron in Seattle was part of a prank, rather than an act of vandalism. Instagram user AndreysMyGov revealed that the spray paint was intended for an upcoming video, supported by images of the car with varying markings and mentions of a forthcoming prank video by TwinzTV. Additionally, the owner of the vehicle hinted on Instagram that the world was pranked even though the video had yet to be aired. Contrastingly, social media reactions varied, with some users speculating it as an act of activism or vandalism by a jilted lover, without direct knowledge of the purported prank. Although these outraged or speculative reactions spread, the consistent references to the involvement of YouTube and Instagram personalities in planning and executing the graffiti for video content strongly supports the claim that the incident was staged for entertainment rather than an act of vandalism.", "69": "A claim by a Catholic priest, Father John Micheal O'Neal, that he encountered God as a woman during a near-death experience has been widely disputed. While O'Neal insists he met a feminine God after being declared dead for 48 minutes, the Archdiocese of Boston, including spokesperson Terrence Donilon and Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley, has dismissed the account, citing an absence of record of his priesthood and suggesting hallucinations linked to the near-death incident. Further skepticism arises as external investigations highlight that reports originated from a satirical website, and the purported images of O'Neal used in media are stock photos. These factors collectively cast significant doubt on the authenticity of O'Neal's claim.", "158": "Groucho Marx did make a risqu\u00e9 remark about his cigar to a female contestant, Mrs. Story, who had 19 children on his radio show \"You Bet Your Life.\" The conversation went as follows: after Mrs. Story explained her large family by saying she loves her children and husband, Groucho quipped, \"I love my cigar, too, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while.\" This exchange was indeed recorded but was cut from the broadcast by the show's censor due to concerns about its appropriateness, hence it was never aired and no copies of the infamous outtake are known to have survived. The legendary interaction occurred during a radio-only period, three years before the television debut of the show, and only the live studio audience heard the remark.", "278": "The tradition of the Argentine President adopting a seventh child as a godchild, initiated in 1907 and formalized in 1973, was rooted in combating stigma and superstition around the \"lobiz\u00f3n,\" a creature from local legend believed to transform the seventh son into a werewolf. President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s adoption of Yair Tawil, the first Jewish seventh son to be adopted under this tradition, continues the practice. However, it is important to note that contemporary historians and reports clarify that the adoption is not meant to prevent a transformation into a werewolf, but rather to honor a cultural tradition and provide social benefits like education. The intertwining of folklore and tradition has led to confused interpretations, but the primary aim of the adoption is to protect children from historical societal abuses associated with the myth, not from becoming werewolves themselves.", "15": "A crater discovered near Managua's airport sparked claims from Nicaraguan officials that it was caused by a meteorite, possibly from the asteroid 2014 RC.

Despite this interest and Clinton's refusal to debate Sanders in California before the June 7 primary, Trump eventually decided it was inappropriate to debate the second-place Democratic candidate. He cited the Democratic nominating process as rigged and expressed dissatisfaction with the networks' lack of generosity toward charitable causes. Thus, Trump ultimately decided against debating Sanders, opting to wait to debate the lead Democratic candidate.", "23": "Multiple reports suggest that Robert Plant, despite being offered a lucrative $800 million reunion contract for Led Zeppelin by Richard Branson, tore up the contract, refusing to join the proposed 35-city reunion tour. His publicist has denied these claims, labeling the story as \"rubbish.\" Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones were reportedly on board with the idea, fueled by substantial financial incentives and an extended tour proposition.

The remains included unidentified or unclaimed body parts, managed similarly to medical waste without disclosure to the families involved. The practice, which ceased in 2008, received public exposure only in 2011 largely due to a media blackout on operations involving fallen troops that lasted until 2009. This lack of earlier media coverage supported the claim that the mainstream media initially ignored the issue.", "215": "The claim that the NRA banned the carrying of guns from their own national convention is not entirely accurate. While it is true that firearms were banned in the Bridgestone Arena during an NRA-sponsored concert, attendees were allowed to carry firearms in the Music City Center as per Tennessee law, provided they had the proper licensing. The confusion may arise from the fact that the display guns at vendor booths had their firing pins removed, a common safety measure at such events. Therefore, the NRA did not universally ban guns at the convention, but specific areas under certain circumstances adhered to pre-existing venue policies.", "64": "Josh Paler Lin, a YouTuber known for pranks, created a social experiment video where he gave $100 to a homeless man named Thomas, expecting him to buy alcohol.

This tradition, which was extended to include children of all religions in 2009, aims to counteract an old superstition claiming that the seventh son becomes a werewolf. However, the claim that this adoption was specifically to prevent Yair from becoming a werewolf appears to be a conflation of separate traditions. Historian Daniel Balmaceda clarified that the tale of the \"lobison\" or werewolf is unrelated to the historic presidential custom of adopting the seventh child, a point that suggests the president's action was misconstrued in some reports as an attempt to prevent a transformation into a werewolf.", "57": "The claim that a NYC high school student nicknamed 'Teen Wolf' made $72 million on the stock market has been widely disputed and corrected by multiple sources, including the student himself, Mohammed Islam. Islam has acknowledged that while he has made some profits from trading, the specific figure of $72 million is inaccurate and he estimated his earnings to be just a few million dollars. This sensational figure was amplified by media and is not representative of his actual trading outcomes. Islam's actual net worth is in the high eight figures, but this is not solely from trading stocks. He hopes to pursue a future in establishing a hedge fund and continues trading primarily in Crude Oil futures, Gold futures, and small to mid-cap equities, inspired by successful traders.", "22": "The Nigerian government announced a ceasefire with Boko Haram, purportedly securing the release of over 200 kidnapped schoolgirls. However, Boko promises to free the girls have been repeatedly contradicted by the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, who released videos dismissing the truce claims and stating the girls were married off and had converted to Islam. Despite government announcements, continued attacks and statements from Boko Haram highlight ongoing violence and the absence of a ceasefire. Doubts about the authenticity of the government's Boko Haram negotiator and the effectiveness of the ceasefire deal have been raised, casting further skepticism on the agreement's validity.", "9": "The authenticity of an audio recording purporting to capture the gunshots that killed Michael Brown is under intense scrutiny. Former LAPD officer David Klinger and CNN analyst Tom Fuentes have expressed doubts about the tape's legitimacy, suggesting it might be a hoax, potentially fabricated to mislead the public. However, the video messaging app Glide has verified the authenticity and timing of another recording, which does capture the sound of gunfire that, according to forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg, includes a pause between shots. This recording has been turned over to the FBI and aligns with an autopsy report stating Brown was shot multiple times.", "343": "Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kircher officially adopted Yair Tawil, a seventh son of a Jewish family, as her godson, which marked the first time a Jewish child received such an honor under an Argentine tradition. This tradition, established in the early 1900s and later formalized in law, originally extended only to Catholic families until a 2009 decree. The ceremony, involving Hanukkah candle lighting, was described as \"magical\" by the president. This custom, often linked with a myth wherein the seventh son turns into a werewolf, aims to protect these children from superstitions that previously led to abandonment or harm. However, historians clarify that this adoption practice and the werewolf myth are not connected; the custom was rather inspired by European emigrant traditions and was adopted to prevent social stigmas against large families.", "205": "A carbon monoxide (CO) spike on the West Coast has been interpreted in conflicting ways regarding its potential as an earthquake predictor. Geophysicist Ramesh Singh suggested that bursts of CO emitted from seismic faults could serve as early warning signals for earthquakes. Contrary to his view, other evidence indicates that recent elevated levels of CO are attributable to factors such as high pressure weather conditions leading to smog, wildfires in western Canada, methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon storage site, and errors in satellite data reporting due to instrument malfunctions. Experts like Vidale emphasize that the current scientific consensus is that no existing method, including CO emission analysis, can reliably predict earthquakes.", "72": "Reports and rumors have circulated that KFC received a business license to sell marijuana in its Colorado restaurants, with claims of incorporating pot dispensaries in franchise locations and selling items infused with cannabis. Some sources suggest the move is driven by the lucrative marijuana market in Colorado and aim to boost sales through items appealing to marijuana users, like \"Bong Time Biscuits\" and \"Smashed Potatoes.\" However, skepticism arises from the credibility of the source, the Racket Report, known for satirical content, and the absence of official confirmation from KFC or its parent company, YUM Brands. Despite circulating claims, there remains substantial doubt about the authenticity of these reports as KFC has not mentioned such a development on its official news channels, and legal and banking challenges complicate such a venture, casting further skepticism on the likelihood of KFC selling marijuana alongside its traditional offerings.", "252": "Dylan Thomas experienced a severely uncomfortable sensation while holidaying in Bali, leading to the discovery of a creature burrowing under his skin. Initially believed to be a spider and described similarly in size and its trail of blisters, significant doubt arose with an expert, Dr. Volker Framenau, pointing out that spiders do not have the capacity to burrow into skin and suspected it more likely to be a burrowing mite. Despite initial treatments for an insect bite, the creature was removed from underneath Thomas's skin by doctors and sent for testing to confirm its identity, raising questions about the exact nature of the creature involved.", "363": "The Nigerian government announced a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram, intended to secure the release of over 200 abducted schoolgirls. Despite this announcement by Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, Boko Haram's continued attacks and the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, outright denying any truce, cast serious doubts on the agreement's validity. Furthermore, concerns arose regarding the credibility of Boko Haram's negotiator, Danladi Ahmadu, with suspicions about his actual connection to the group. The persistent violence and Shekau's public rejection of negotiations suggest the ceasefire might be non-existent, leading to confusion and skepticism within Nigeria and among global observers.", "31": "Dylan Thomas, a 21-year-old Australian, reported a tropical spider had burrowed through a scar on his abdomen and lived under his skin for three days during his trip to Bali. Medical professionals initially misdiagnosed the condition as an insect bite but later extracted a dead spider from his abdomen. However, arachnid experts have expressed skepticism about this claim, arguing it is biologically implausible for a spider to behave in such a manner. They suggest a different organism might be involved, or the story could be fabricated since such behavior contradicts known spider biology.", "285": "The claim that Argentina's President, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, adopted a Jewish boy to prevent him from turning into a werewolf merges fact with folklore. While it is true that the president adopted Yair Tawil, becoming the first Jewish child to receive such an honor, this tradition actually stemmed from a custom initiated over a century ago aimed at combating superstitions around the seventh son becoming a werewolf, known as \"el lobison.\" However, Daniel Balmaceda, an Argentine historian, has clarified that the werewolf legend and the presidential adoption custom are unrelated, indicating that the modern adoption practices do not aim to prevent any supernatural transformations but are instead a symbolic continuation of an old custom, extending now beyond Catholics to include Jewish children. Thus, the belief that the president\u2019s adoption was specifically to prevent a werewolf transformation is based on a misunderstanding of the tradition\u2019s historical context and purpose.", "237": "A weather reporter, Mike Seidel, was mistakenly believed to have been caught urinating in the snow during a live broadcast, as he turned his back to the camera while on-air. However, it was later clarified by NBC anchor Brian Williams and The Weather Channel spokesperson Shirley Powell that Seidel was actually trying to establish communication with the control room using his cellphone after losing signal. It was confirmed that he was dialing his phone and not engaging in the act of writing his name in the snow with urine. This misunderstanding led to requests for apologies towards Seidel from social media for the false accusation.", "14": "The Nigerian government announced a ceasefire with Boko Haram, optimistic about the release of over 200 kidnapped schoolgirls. However, attacks continued, raising doubts about the completeness of the ceasefire and whether all Boko Haram factions were involved. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau denied any truce or negotiations, stating the girls had been married off and converted to Islam, contradicting government claims. Conflicting reports and ongoing violence have cast skepticism on the government's announcement, highlighting a disconnect between official statements and the group's actions, thereby undermining the credibility of the claim that the girls will soon be freed.", "103": "A photograph claiming to show a 50-foot crab dubbed \"Crabzilla\" in Whitstable has been widely dismissed as a hoax by experts and online debunkers. Dr. Verity Nye and Paul Clark, both marine experts, argue against the photo's authenticity, citing the improbability of such a large crab existing in shallow waters and the known maximum sizes of the largest crabs, like the Japanese spider crab. The image, which went viral, was suggested to be an altered photo using simple Photoshop techniques. Despite initial intrigue and curiosity, the creator of the image, Quinton Winter, admitted the depiction was intended as a bit of fun and not to be taken seriously, acknowledging widespread skepticism and criticism regarding its veracity.", "329": "Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's adoption of Yair Tawil as her godson is rooted in a longstanding local tradition rather than an attempt to prevent him from turning into a werewolf. The tradition, which started in 1907 and became inclusive of all children in 1974, involves the president adopting the seventh son or daughter of a family to provide them with a gold medal and educational scholarship. While there is a folklore about the seventh son turning into a werewolf, historians and reports clarify that the presidential adoption custom is not connected to werewolf legends. The practice aims to counteract the stigma and historical fears associated with the folktale.", "51": "A Catholic priest named Father John Micheal O'Neal reportedly died for 48 minutes and upon revival, claimed to have encountered a divine feminine figure he identified as God. This claim, which he described with warm and motherly attributes, stirred skepticism and controversy. Local church authorities and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston have distanced themselves from the story, citing that they have no record of O'Neal as a priest, and suggesting his experiences might be hallucinations from the near-death event. Furthermore, the origin of the story is traced back to a satirical news website, casting further doubt on its authenticity, with indications that the image of O'Neal might be a stock photo. The scenario reflects a mixture of personal transformative experience and broad public skepticism.", "166": "Accusations have surfaced claiming that Edible Arrangements, through the Farid Foundation, funds Hamas. These claims primarily stem from donations to various Muslim organizations, including Islamic Relief and ICNA. However, substantial evidence or direct links proving that these funds support terrorist activities or Hamas specifically has not been presented. Defenders, including Edible Arrangement's legal representatives and the Anti-Defamation League, argue that such assertions lack clear proof and contextual understanding. They emphasize the foundation's contributions to non-controversial causes like women's shelters through ICNA Relief USA. The allegations have spurred calls for boycotting the company, despite its strong denunciation of terrorism and diverse franchise ownership.", "46": "Reports and investigations challenge the authenticity of a photo purportedly showing the slain body of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, suggesting it could be a doctored image of Sami Hafez Al-Abdullah, an ethnic Albanian militant killed in Syria in 2013. Several media and social media channels circulated the allegedly manipulated photo following claims of al-Baghdadi's death in a U.S. airstrike. Meanwhile, conflicting reports exist about al-Baghdadi's actual status, with sources claiming he was either severely wounded or killed in different incidents, adding to the uncertainty and doubts about the photo's veracity.", "336": "Jasmine Tridevil, a Florida massage therapist, claimed to have undergone surgery to implant a third breast to become unattractive to men and pursue an MTV reality show, spending $20,000 and consulting over 50 doctors. However, suspicions arose as no other individuals took her photos and her website was linked to known hoax provider Alisha Hessler. Crucially, a police report revealed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" in her luggage, suggesting fabrication. Additionally, ethical concerns were raised by professionals stating no reputable surgeon would perform such a procedure, further supporting the hoax theory.", "129": "A viral video from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport showed a group of bystanders tackling a man shouting homophobic slurs. Speculation arose that actor Paul Rudd was involved, fueled by his apparent resemblance to one of the interveners and a reported sighting of him on a Dallas flight around the same time. However, Rudd's representative firmly denied his involvement, stating that he was not present at the scene. Despite ongoing debate and claims on social media suggesting Rudd's participation, credible sources and official statements confirm that Paul Rudd was not the person who helped restrain the attacker.", "280": "Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner adopted Yair Tawil, the seventh son of a Jewish family, marking the first time a Jewish child was adopted under a national tradition that dates back to 1907, originally intended to protect seventh sons from a superstition that they would turn into werewolves. The tradition, which included a presidential decree in 2009 that expanded eligibility to non-Catholic children, aims to dispel the stigma surrounding \"cursed\" seventh sons. Although the adoption occurred during a Hanukkah celebration, sources clarify that the act was not to prevent Yair from turning into a werewolf, but rather to continue a long-standing tradition of offering presidential protection and benefits such as a gold medal and educational scholarships. The intertwining of this event with the lobiz\u00f3n myth appears to be a sensational addition rather than based on factual necessity.", "146": "Several studies and analyses challenge the claim that women's menstrual cycles synchronize when they live or work closely together. Research indicates that the perceived synchronization can be attributed to random variations in cycle start dates rather than an actual physiological phenomenon. One study observed no significant statistical changes in cycle timing among pairs and triples of women, whereas another community-driven investigation with over 360 pairs found that most pairs actually saw an increase in the difference between cycle start dates over time. Additionally, a lack of support for synchronization has been noted even in natural settings, such as unindustrialized populations. The persistence of the synchronization belief might stem from misconceptions about the expected variance in menstrual cycles by chance alone, lending more weight to rare instances of close cycle onsets. Collectively, these findings significantly undermine the existence of menstrual synchrony among females.", "124": "Reports concerning the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. airstrike have been conflicting. Multiple sources, including Iraqi media and Kurdish intelligence, initially claimed Baghdadi was killed; however, subsequent reports suggest he was severely injured but survived. The Pentagon has not confirmed his death, and a photo circulated as evidence of his demise was identified as a doctored image of another deceased militant. Further ambiguity arises from reports of airstrikes killing close aides to Baghdadi, rather than Baghdadi himself, fueling speculations of his possible survival and treatment in Syria. The situation remains unclear amidst ongoing U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS leadership.", "139": "Reports indicate that some factories in China have been producing a rice substitute made from potatoes, sweet potatoes, and synthetic resins (plastic), which mimic real rice's texture and aroma but can be harmful when consumed. Allegations of this \"plastic rice\" have led to warnings that eating it is equivalent to ingesting plastic bags. Various sources, including media and customs officials in different countries, suggest that this synthetic rice is difficult to distinguish from real rice based on appearance and smell, leading to confiscations and complaints from consumers. However, some investigations have refuted the claims, finding no evidence of plastic in suspected rice samples, suggesting discrepancies in the verification of such claims.", "290": "The campaign featuring Peruvian men unknowingly catcalling their disguised mothers, orchestrated by Everlast and Paremos el Acoso Callejero, aimed to highlight and combat street harassment. Although the stings were staged with actors, they were rooted in real-life sentiments and incidents, portraying deep shame when harassers realized they were targeting their mothers. Despite debates about the authenticity and ethical implications of such setups, the videos effectively raised awareness and provoked reactions by vividly illustrating the disrespect of catcalling. Sceptics argue these methods might trivialize the issue, but supporters believe it's a genius way to make harassers rethink their actions. This mirrors the divide in public opinion on whether such shock tactics genuinely contribute to behavior change or merely provide sensational content.", "218": "Tyson Foods briefly replaced Labor Day with Eid al-Fitr as a paid holiday at its Shelbyville, Tennessee, plant following a union agreement in 2008, predominantly to accommodate its Somali employees. However, this change was quickly reassessed and modified, reinstating Labor Day and keeping Eid al-Fitr as an additional paid holiday for that year only. Since then, Labor Day remains a paid holiday for all Tyson Foods employees, and the claim that Tyson has permanently dropped Labor Day in favor of Eid al-Fitr is incorrect. The alteration was specific to the Shelbyville plant and was a temporary, one-time adjustment.", "98": "The claim of a 50-foot \"Crabzilla\" spotted off the coast of Britain has garnered attention but is widely disputed by experts and observers. Paul Clark from the Natural History Museum and Dr. Verity Nye from Southampton University have identified the image as a hoax, citing the physical impossibility and identifying digital manipulation elements. Quinton Winter, the curator behind the initial publication, admitted the image was part of an artistic project and did not expect it to be taken seriously. Despite its popularity online, the consensus among marine biologists and photo analysts is that \"Crabzilla\" is a fictional creation, not a real marine creature. The largest real crabs, like the Japanese spider crab, grow much smaller and inhabit different waters.", "219": "Several reports and statements debunk the idea of Muslim \"no-go zones\" in the United States, France, and Britain, where it is alleged that local laws are replaced by Sharia Law and authorities do not enter. Critics, including a terrorism expert and high-profile leaders, have admitted their errors in propagating this concept and apologized for misleading statements. While it was claimed that these zones are lawless and exclusive to Muslims, subsequent clarifications revealed that these assertions were inaccurate. No formal designation or credible evidence supports the existence of such zones where specific religious exclusion and autonomous legal systems are implemented.", "21": "The story of Lucita Sandoval, an alleged teacher implicated in a sex tape with a 16-year-old student, has been debunked. Investigations revealed that the woman in the tape is not a teacher at the school mentioned, and the supposed student is actually a college-aged adult. The narrative that emerged from the video's exposure falsely framed the woman, eventually identified as someone from a different city, as engaging in inappropriate relations with a minor. This misinformation spread rapidly online, leading to severe misrepresentation and unwarranted claims against her character. The original assumption that the woman was a sexual predator turned out to be part of a hoax, with the real identities and context of the individuals involved being misrepresented.", "196": "A lawsuit filed against the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin alleges discriminatory practices against transgender students, including a directive for guidance counselors to issue bright green wristbands to transgender students to monitor their restroom usage. This practice reportedly made student Ash Whitaker, a transgender boy, feel unsafe and stigmatized.

He experienced a searing sensation and saw a red trail on his abdomen, which led to the discovery and removal of the spider. However, arachnid expert Dr. Volker Framenau contested this claim, stating that spiders do not have the physical capability to burrow into skin and suggested that a burrowing mite could be a more plausible explanation. The actual identity of the creature is pending laboratory results. Thomas shared his discomfort and ordeal on Facebook, where he humorously anticipated gaining superpowers and referred to himself as \"Spiderman.", "251": "Dylan Thomas, an Australian man on vacation in Bali, claimed that a tropical spider burrowed under his skin through an appendix scar, causing a red trail and uncomfortable symptoms over three days until it was removed by doctors. His ordeal was documented through Facebook posts and has gathered significant attention. However, some arachnid experts have raised skepticism about the plausibility of such an event, suggesting the biology of spiders would not support the behavior described and hinting the incident could involve another organism or be a fabrication. This doubt introduces ambiguity into the sensational claim.", "362": "A meteorite's landing in Nicaragua, creating a 40-foot crater near Managua's airport, is debated among experts. While some Nicaraguan officials and residents believe the crater resulted from a meteorite linked to the nearby passage of asteroid 2014 RC, NASA and other astronomers express skepticism. Doubts arise due to the absence of an observed fireball, which typically accompanies such events, and the timeline mismatch between the asteroid's closest approach and the crater's formation. Additionally, no meteoritic debris has been found at the site, and no eyewitnesses report seeing a streak of light in the sky, further casting doubt on the meteorite claim. Scientists suggest further investigation to determine the crater's origin accurately.", "25": "Mohammed Islam, a 17-year-old high school student, gained national attention with claims of having made $72 million through stock trading, which was prominently featured in a New York Magazine profile. However, Islam has refuted this amount, stating in several interviews including with CNBC that the reported figure is vastly inflated and incorrect, clarifying that his actual earnings from trading are closer to a few million dollars. He expressed discomfort with the media portrayal and the unwanted hype it generated. Islam confirmed that he has made money trading but nowhere near the $72 million initially reported, with his net worth being in the \"high eight figures,\" not necessarily all from trading.", "201": "Reports indicate a concerning trend known as \"sex roulette,\" where orgies are held with one undisclosed HIV-positive attendee, purportedly for added thrill. Originating claims were made by a doctor in Barcelona and a Serbian stripper, suggesting these parties are rising in popularity among certain groups, particularly gay men. However, skepticism exists regarding the veracity of these claims, with criticisms highlighting logistical challenges and minimal supporting evidence beyond anecdotal reports.

The adoption tradition, where the president acts as a godparent to the seventh son or daughter of a family to provide them with a medal and education, has existed in Argentina for over a century. Historically, this was related to a superstition that the seventh son would turn into a werewolf, known as \"El Lobison,\" but these two customs are not officially linked. Historian Daniel Balmaceda and multiple news sources agree that the werewolf element is merely a sensational addition to the story of a cultural and non-supernatural presidential custom, which now includes children of all religions following a decree passed in 2009. Thus, the notion that Kirchner's adoption was to prevent werewolf transformation is not based on factual connections between the traditions.", "364": "Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, has released multiple videos denying any ceasefire agreement with the Nigerian government, stating that the abducted schoolgirls have been married off and converted to Islam. Despite the Nigerian government's claims of a truce and ongoing negotiations facilitated by Chad for the girls' release, Shekau mocks these claims and threatens continued violence. Recent military clashes and sustained attacks by Boko Haram further contradict the government's statements of a ceasefire. The group's persistent denial and continued hostile actions strongly suggest that no effective ceasefire is in place.", "112": "A Peruvian public service announcement sponsored by Everlast showcases a creative approach to addressing street harassment by tricking habitual catcallers into harassing their disguised mothers. The humor emerges when the men realize the women they've inappropriately addressed are their own mothers, leading to a mix of shock and embarrassment. The mothers confront their sons, vividly highlighting the disrespect inherent in catcalling. This approach, while provocative and staged for effect, effectively demonstrates the personal impact of street harassment, aligning with the idea that catcalling is never funny unless it turns the tables on the harassers in such a direct and personal way.", "18": "A Bugatti Veyron reportedly had a penis graffiti spray-painted on its bonnet in Seattle, prompting a mix of outrage and amusement online. The graffiti was widely speculated to be an act of vandalism, potentially reducing the car's value significantly. However, reports suggest that the graffiti was orchestrated by YouTube pranksters TwinzTV as part of an upcoming video project, indicating that the act may not have been genuine vandalism but rather a staged event for entertainment.

Mixed reports further complicate the story, with variations circulating online about different children in similar tragic circumstances involving nail guns, which have sparked widespread calls for prayers across social networks.", "154": "Mandatory service charges on restaurant bills are considered a legal obligation for diners, distinct from voluntary tips. Revenue Ruling 2012-18 clarifies that such charges should be categorized as service charges, not tips, implying they must be paid. Various legal interpretations and incidents demonstrate the complexity and enforcement of this differentiation. In some instances, diners have been legally compelled to pay these charges; however, court cases show differing outcomes based on regional laws and specific case circumstances. New York, for example, mandates that any charge believed to be a gratuity by the diner must be treated as traditional tips, highlighting the importance of clear communication and labeling by restaurants to avoid legal confusion and potential fines.", "4": "NASA has expressed skepticism regarding the claim that a meteorite caused a large crater near Managua's international airport, citing the absence of a visible fireball or eyewitness reports of such, which would typically accompany a meteorite impact of that size. Experts noted that the energy needed to create the crater would typically produce a significant fireball visible over a wide area, especially in a densely populated region like Managua. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the timeline with asteroid 2014 RC and no reported meteorite fragments at the site further fuel doubts.

Historical and recent reports clarify that the custom of presidential adoption, originally established to prevent infanticide and abandonment tied to this superstition, has transitioned over the years. Yair, the first Jewish godson adopted under a revised law, was officially adopted for the traditional protection and privileges, not due to any belief in werewolf legends. Despite this, some media outlets erroneously reported that the adoption was to prevent him from becoming a werewolf, perpetuating confusion between the lore and the government tradition.", "97": "Joan Rivers's death has drawn significant attention due to allegations concerning her treating ENT doctor, Gwen Korovin. Reports suggest Korovin took a selfie with Rivers while she was under anesthesia and performed an unauthorized biopsy on Rivers's vocal cords at Yorkville Endoscopy.

Investigations by news outlets and Snopes revealed strong evidence suggesting it was a hoax, including a police report from Tampa International Airport listing a \"3 breast prosthesis\" in her recovered stolen luggage. This information, alongside her history of seeking viral fame, has led most to conclude that the third breast is not real but a fabricated appendage aimed at gaining attention and notoriety.", "63": "A widely circulated video purporting to show a bird defecating on President Vladimir Putin during a speech at the unveiling of a World War I monument was revealed to be a hoax. Investigations and reports, including a side-by-side comparison of the video and original footage, confirmed that the incident did not occur as depicted; in all other footage and images from the event, Putin's suit remains clean. Numerous news outlets and fact-checking organizations, after initially being misled by the convincing nature of the doctored video, issued corrections once the fabricated elements came to light. The video's false nature illustrates the vulnerability of public perception to manipulated content online.", "177": "Utility crews from Alabama were initially believed to have been turned away from helping in New Jersey post-Hurricane Sandy due to their non-union status. However, this was based on misunderstandings related to union affiliation documents and arrangements. New Jersey officials, utility spokespeople, and union representatives clarified that both union and non-union crews were welcome and actively participating in restoration efforts. The confusion was largely due to miscommunication regarding the paperwork and requirements for out-of-state utility workers. Ultimately, the claim that crews were rejected solely on union status was debunked, with several utilities confirming their active involvement in recovery efforts without union-related issues.", "54": "Claims about Cesar Millan's death from a heart attack have spread online, primarily via social media and questionable news sites. However, these reports contain several inconsistencies and red flags, including details from unreliable or satirically-named authors, spelling and grammatical errors, and a lack of credible sources or confirmations. Furthermore, no reputable media outlets have corroborated the news of his death, and his active social media presence around the time the reports emerged further casts doubt on their veracity. Considering these factors, the claim that Cesar Millan has died appears to be a celebrity death hoax, unsupported by evidence or reliable confirmation.", "92": "Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist from Florida, reportedly underwent a $20,000 surgery to add a third breast with the intention of making herself less attractive to men and to potentially secure a reality TV show on MTV.

Additionally, evidence presented by a top surgeon and historical patterns of hoaxes associated with the same individual cast serious doubts on the veracity of her claim, suggesting it might be a fabricated story.", "322": "Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist from Tampa, claimed she underwent surgery to add a third breast, allegedly to become unattractive to men and pursue a reality TV career. However, evidence emerged suggesting this was a hoax. A stolen luggage report from Tampa International Airport listed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" belonging to Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Hessler. Further investigations by fact-checking websites and news reports highlighted the absence of credible medical documentation or reports confirming the authenticity of the surgery. Despite her elaborate claims and media appearances, the overall evidence strongly leans towards the story being fabricated for attention and potential financial gain.", "17": "Concerns were initially raised about the authenticity of an audio recording CNN aired, purportedly capturing the gunshots that killed Michael Brown. Critics, including former LAPD officer David Klinger and CNN analyst Tom Fuentes, suggested it might be a hoax, citing potential dubbing and missing initial shots. However, the video messaging service Glide confirmed the authenticity and precise timing of the recording, stating it was captured via their app, which records and transmits simultaneously, providing an exact timestamp. Glide\u2019s verification supports the authenticity although it remains uncertain if the background sounds are definitively from the Brown shooting. Glide has communicated this information to the FBI.", "111": "The claim of a 50-foot \"Crabzilla\" spotted in the waters off Whitstable, Kent has sparked interest and skepticism. Artist Quinton Winter, creator of Weird Whitstable, shared an image dubbed 'Crabzilla,' but invertebrate experts, including Paul Clark from the Natural History Museum and Dr. Verity Nye from Southampton University, dismissed the photograph as a hoax, attributing it to clever Photoshop manipulation. They noted that the largest known crabs, the Japanese spider crabs, grow much smaller and live in deep waters, unlike the shallow coast where Crabzilla was allegedly spotted. Despite its viral nature and enthralling online viewers, professionals and photo analysts confirm that the creature does not exist and is a product of digital alteration.", "232": "A YouTube video by Josh Paler Lin shows him giving $100 to a homeless man named Thomas, who then buys food to share with others, challenging stereotypes about homelessness. The video gained significant attention and raised over $50,000 to help Thomas. However, its authenticity was questioned by an eyewitness, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who claims he saw Josh and Thomas together in a car before filming, suggesting they might have staged the scenario. Despite these allegations, Josh Paler Lin and many viewers believe the video's impact is positive, whether staged or not, as it has helped raise considerable funds for homeless people.", "365": "A video campaign sponsored by Everlast titled \"S\u00edlbale a tu madre\" (\"Catcall Your Mother\") has gone viral, featuring sexist Peruvian men being tricked into harassing their disguised mothers on the streets of Lima. Upon realizing their actions, the men are confronted and chastised by their mothers, leading to shock and embarrassment. The mothers, after revealing their identities, express disappointment and anger towards their sons' disrespectful behaviors. This impactful social experiment aims to raise awareness about street harassment and to promote respect towards women. The campaign has had wide reach and success in promoting its message against sexual harassment.", "222": "U.S. troops deployed overseas are experiencing changes in meal provisions; however, the claim that breakfast is no longer provided due to budget cuts is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some bases, particularly in Paktika province during operational drawdown, have replaced hot breakfasts with MREs (Meals Ready to Eat), this decision is primarily linked to logistical considerations associated with base closures rather than direct national budget cuts. Moreover, soldiers at these bases continue to receive meal options, including MREs for breakfast and standard meals for other times. Defense officials emphasize that the broader policy has not eliminated breakfast entirely, and most troops still receive hot meals, including breakfast, at other locations.", "226": "Misinformation has spread regarding the financial support provided by the federal government to refugees in Canada, comparing it unfavorably with what is offered to retirees. The reality is that refugees receive a one-time start-up payment and a temporary monthly allowance based on provincial social assistance rates, which is often misconstrued as a higher ongoing monthly benefit. In contrast, Canadian pensioners receive benefits such as the Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan, which provide consistent monthly payments that, on average, are comparable or higher than temporary assistance provided to refugees. The confusion stems from the erroneous inclusion of one-time start-up payments to refugees as part of their monthly allowance in certain widely circulated claims.", "194": "An Islamic tribunal operates in the Dallas area, using Sharia as a guideline for resolving disputes among willing participants, strictly within the framework of U.S. law. It does not replace or override federal or state laws, and its decisions are nonbinding. Participants can opt out of the tribunal's decisions and take their cases to civil courts if they wish. The tribunal's existence and operations do not signify the establishment of Sharia law as the governing law in Texas; instead, it functions similarly to other faith-based arbitration services that operate legally under the Federal Arbitration Act in the U.S.", "43": "Reports suggest conflicting information about the fate of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi following U.S. airstrikes. While some sources claimed Baghdadi was killed near Mosul, the Pentagon denied these reports, stating that Baghdadi was not dead. Additional evidence suggests Baghdadi was severely wounded in an airstrike and is currently receiving medical treatment near the Syrian border. Despite circulating rumors and a doctored photo purporting to show Baghdadi's body, his exact condition and location remain uncertain, reflecting the ongoing challenges in verifying such events in conflict zones. Meanwhile, airstrikes have successfully targeted other key ISIS figures, including Baghdadi's top aide, which demonstrates the persistent threat to ISIS leadership.", "123": "Mohammed Islam, a high school student at Stuyvesant in New York, was reported to have made $72 million from the stock market, which he later denied in a CNBC interview, stating that the actual figure was closer to a few million dollars and that the $72 million figure quoted by various media outlets was exaggerated. Islam, who is involved in trading primarily in Crude Oil futures, Gold futures, and small to mid-cap equities, emphasized that he has made profits but nowhere near the claimed $72 million. Media sources later amended their statements to reflect that the initially reported figures were based more on rumors than documented evidence.", "27": "Several documents analyzed claim to show that a bird pooped on Vladimir Putin during a speech at a World War I monument unveiling. However, further investigation reveals these claims are false. A YouTube video that went viral, showing the alleged incident, has been debunked as a fake. Careful examination and additional footage show no signs of bird feces on Putin at the event. Multiple sources, including side-by-side video comparisons and photographs from the event, confirm that Putin's suit remained clean throughout the speech, substantiating that the supposedly humorous incident never occurred.", "163": "A Michigan farmer's social media post claiming he was forced to dump 40,000 edible cherries to accommodate cherry imports sparked widespread debate. However, experts in the field clarified that this action was not directly to make space for imported cherries but was part of a regulatory effort by the Cherry Industry Administrative Board to stabilize market prices and supply. Farmers are indeed required to set aside a portion of their crop, but alternatives exist such as processing or selling these surplus cherries in new markets or overseas. Additionally, it is not true that farmers are barred from donating or using these restricted cherries; they have options to utilize them for products like pies or jams. The farmer's claim largely stems from misunderstandings or misrepresentations of the federal marketing order's implications and functionalities.", "155": "Organ donations are conducted under strict ethical and legal guidelines ensuring that vital organ donors are declared dead\u2014either through brain death or cessation of heart function\u2014before organ harvesting. Brain dead individuals are legally considered dead, incapable of experiencing pain due to a lack of upper brain function, a status confirmed through rigorous testing. In cases of non-heart-beating donations, appropriate sedatives and pain medication are administered to prevent suffering, further reinforcing that donors do not experience pain during the procedure. There is no support for the claim that donors are alive and unanesthetized during organ donation; rather, documented practices and legal requirements prevent such scenarios.", "198": "During the Benghazi attack, top Obama administration officials, including the President, were reported to have watched real-time footage and were actively involved in response efforts. Shortly after the attack began, President Obama instructed the Secretary of Defense and other officials to use all necessary resources to protect Americans, challenging the notion that they did nothing to intervene. Despite these direct orders to deploy military aid, bureaucratic delays and the physical distance of U.S. forces arguably affected the timely intervention, but there's no evidence supporting the claim that officials deliberately refrained from acting to assist those under siege.", "183": "The claim that Hillary Clinton received over 800,000 non-citizen votes in the 2016 election is supported by extrapolations from a study by political scientist Jesse Richman, who estimated that 6.4 percent of the 20 million adult non-citizens in the U.S. voted, potentially adding approximately 834,381 votes to Clinton's tally. However, several critiques challenge the reliability of this study. Critics argue that the study uses flawed methodology by extrapolating from a small, potentially inaccurate number of self-reported non-citizen voters in surveys. Furthermore, repeated surveys indicate inconsistencies in respondents' citizenship status over time, suggesting some responses might be incorrect. These criticisms imply that the claim lacks solid empirical support and the study's conclusions are contested within the academic community.", "186": "The documentary series \"Mermaids: The Body Found\" and its sequel, \"Mermaids: The New Evidence\" on Animal Planet, portrayed as factual documentaries, are in fact hoaxes involving fictitious scenarios about mermaids. These programs included staged videos, fake interviews with actors posing as scientists, and suggested a government conspiracy covering up the existence of mermaids. Although the documentaries were presented in a factually convincing manner, both featured disclaimers in their closing credits stating that the content was fictional. This caused confusion among viewers, many of whom believed the documentaries were real, prompting official denials and clarifications from agencies like NOAA. The programs have been criticized for blurring the lines between science fiction and documentary, which effectively misled viewers about the actual existence of mermaids.", "202": "The claim that Mississippi has passed a bill granting churchgoers the right to shoot and kill citizens at will is misleading. The legislation, known as the \"Mississippi Church Protection Act,\" allows churches to form security programs, wherein designated members can be trained and armed to protect congregants. These members, similar to police in their jurisdiction, are protected under legal and civil immunity if a killing is deemed justifiable homicide while performing their duties. However, the law does not grant churchgoers blanket authority to kill citizens at will but sets specific conditions under which force might be legally used, emphasizing training and permitting for armed members.", "176": "While there are rumors and discussions about the use of \"point-to-point\" speed cameras along highways to automatically issue tickets based on travel time between checkpoints, the evidence provides mixed responses. In one case, it is claimed that such systems exist and are in operational use, recording the times a vehicle enters and exits a highway to calculate speed and issue fines if the limits are exceeded. However, other sources refute the use of such systems, citing legal restrictions and denials from officials, such as a department spokesman stating that the existing cameras and radars are only for monitoring traffic flow and are not used for issuing speeding tickets due to legislative constraints. Additionally, a specific allegation regarding the implementation of a point-to-point speed enforcement system on the Westlink M7 has been officially declared as a hoax by the motorway's management. Thus, while the technology and concept exist, the actual use in law enforcement via point-to-link speed cameras on highways appears limited and varies by jurisdiction.", "275": "Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist from Tampa, claimed to have undergone surgery to implant a third breast to become unattractive to men and pursue a reality TV career. Despite her claims and media appearances, significant evidence points to the story being a hoax. Investigations by Snopes and news outlets revealed discrepancies, and the decisive evidence came from a police report at Tampa International Airport, which listed a \"3 breast prosthesis\" among the contents of recovered stolen luggage belonging to Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Hessler. This report strongly suggests that the third breast was indeed a fake.", "261": "A small meteorite reportedly struck near Managua, Nicaragua, creating a 16-foot deep, 39-foot wide crater near the city's airport. While local government officials assert it was a meteorite from an asteroid known as 2014 RC, causing a loud explosion heard by residents, NASA and other experts are skeptical due to the lack of eyewitness accounts of a fireball and visible fragments. NASA suggests the crater could have been caused by an energy equivalent to 1 ton of TNT, typically producing a visible fireball, which was not reported. The genuine cause remains under investigation, with local scientists seeking help from international experts.", "122": "Saudi Arabian Airlines has been at the center of controversy regarding claims about plans to introduce gender segregation on its flights. Official statements from the airline have repeatedly denied such plans, with spokespeople like Abdullah Al-Ajhar and Abdul Rahman Al-Fahd clarifying that reports on segregation were misleading or taken out of context. Despite these denials, various media outlets continue to report that the national carrier intends to enforce gender-based seating arrangements following complaints about mixed-gender seating, attributing to rising discomfort among passengers. These conflicting reports create a mixed understanding, with the airline officially dismissing the implementation of gender separation while media speculation continues to suggest otherwise.", "55": "The company Glide has confirmed the authenticity and precise timing of a recording which purportedly captured the sounds of the Michael Brown shooting. Glide ensured the video's timestamp aligns with the incident date, but questions about the authenticity of the audio persist. CNN aired the recording, facing doubts from experts like Tom Fuentes and David Klinger, who suggested it could be a hoax. They raised concerns about possible alterations and the absence of an initial gunshot in the recording. Despite these doubts, an attorney associated with the tape asserted its authenticity, while experts and investigations continue to scrutinize the validity of the audio content.", "181": "Documents investigating the claim that the tetanus vaccine campaigns in Kenya are a plot to sterilize women provide mixed evidence. Some sources, including tests from Kenyan samples alleging the detection of HCG, suggest malicious intent behind the vaccinations. However, most scientific analyses and expert testimonies, including a detailed testing process in Hungary and validation by reputable laboratories, refute these claims, indicating that the vaccines are free of HCG and the campaign is genuinely aimed at eradicating neonatal tetanus. The targeting of women of childbearing age is explained by the need to protect newborns from tetanus via maternal antibodies, not for covert sterilization. Misrepresentations by certain groups have caused significant disruptions to vital immunization efforts."}
